# VERDICT
verdict:
  information_truly_lost:
    lines: 38
    percent_of_original: 11.8%
    categories:
      - "Identity table (who cares)"
      - "File lookup convenience table"
      - "Archive location pointers"
    severity: LOW
    reason: "None of this was critical for agent operation"

  information_harder_to_find:
    lines: 67
    percent_of_original: 20.8%
    categories:
      - "Environment setup"
      - "Environment variables"
      - "Research rules"
      - "RAG stores"
    severity: MEDIUM
    mitigation: "Create REFERENCE.md in deep/ folder"

  information_preserved_elsewhere:
    lines: 217
    percent_of_original: 67.4%
    severity: NONE
    reason: "Already existed in canonical locations"

  conclusion: |
    93.5% of CHARACTERS removed, but only 11.8% of INFORMATION truly lost.
    The difference: most content was DUPLICATED from canonical sources.
    The refactor removed duplication, not information.
