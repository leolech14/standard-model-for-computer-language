The code implements the `id` as an `int`. There is no `FILE` component to the identifier.\n    2.  **Kind Field**: The invariant requires a 'kind' field with possible values of 'Function', 'Class', or 'Variable'. The `AtomDefinition` class does not have a `kind` field. While it has a `fundamental` field (e.g., \"Variables\", \"Functions\"), this field uses a different and broader set of categories (e.g., \"Bits\", \"Primitives\", \"Expressions\", \"Aggregates\") and does not match the required invariant.",
