  summary: |
    Successfully bootstrapped the agent coordination system.

    Created:
    - Complete directory structure (.agent/ with schema/, registry/, runs/)
    - KERNEL.md: Bootstrap file all agents read first
    - manifest.yaml: Machine-readable discovery for automated tools
    - task.schema.yaml: Definition of TASK (strategic, persistent)
    - run.schema.yaml: Definition of RUN (tactical, per-session)
    - registry/INDEX.md: Dashboard for task tracking
    - TASK-000: This bootstrap task
    - TASK-001: Sample migrated from MCP Factory (Python template)

    Architecture validated by Gemini (9/10 soundness, 8/10 completeness).
    System implements Concepts/Objects duality and TASK/RUN separation.

  next_steps:
    - Update registry/INDEX.md with TASK-000 and TASK-001
    - Test the system by having another agent start a RUN
    - Consider adding validator script for schema compliance
    - Migrate remaining MCP Factory tasks to new system
