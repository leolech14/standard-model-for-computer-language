# Centripetal Scan - Round 12 (NANO)

**Query:** SYNTHESIS: Based on all analysis, provide:

1. ONE-SENTENCE summary of what this codebase does
2. THREE key architectural decisions that define it
3. FIVE most important files (with paths)
4. TOP risk: What's most likely to break?
5. TOP opportunity: What's the biggest improvement available?

This is the FINAL summary - make it count.

**Set:** architecture_review
