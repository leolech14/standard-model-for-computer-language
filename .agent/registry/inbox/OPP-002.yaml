title: Fix promote_opportunity.sh multiline bug
source: BARE
discovered_at: '2026-01-23T09:30:00Z'
description: 'The bash-based promote_opportunity.sh uses grep to extract YAML fields,

  which fails for multiline descriptions.


  Root cause: grep only captures first line of multiline YAML values.


  Solution implemented: Python version with proper YAML parsing.

  '
suggested_action: Replace bash script with Python implementation
