# Status: SCOPED
# Priority: MEDIUM (80% confidence)

id: TASK-005
title: Consolidate research directories
description: |
  Merge scattered research outputs to a single canonical location.

  Current State:
  - standard-model-of-code/docs/research/gemini/
  - standard-model-of-code/docs/research/perplexity/
  - context-management/intelligence/logs/ (some research mixed in)

  Target: All research outputs go to standard-model-of-code/docs/research/

  Acceptance Criteria:
  - Single canonical location for all AI research outputs
  - DualFormatSaver configured to use canonical path
  - No research files in context-management/intelligence/

status: SCOPED

# 4D Confidence Matrix
confidence:
  factual: 85       # Research dirs exist, verified in boost_confidence assessment
  alignment: 100    # Core to project organization
  current: 90       # DualFormatSaver already supports configurable paths
  onwards: 95       # Foundation for clean research archive

# Computed: min(85, 100, 90, 95) = 85
# Verdict: READY
