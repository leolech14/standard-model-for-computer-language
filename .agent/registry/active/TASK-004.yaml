  Execute the 5-phase CUTTING_PLAN to simplify the .agent/ infrastructure.

  The project has completed its "bulk phase" with extensive design documents,
  multiple registries, and ambitious automation specs. Now it's time to "cut" -
  eliminate redundancy, consolidate overlap, and simplify to minimal viable system.

  Philosophy: "Worse is Better" - Simple implementations that work beat complex ones.
