# TASK-006: Unify registry locations
# Status: SCOPED
# Priority: HIGH (critical for maintainability)

id: TASK-006
title: Unify registry locations and task systems
description: |
  Document and consolidate the multiple task/registry systems in the repo.

  Current Fragmentation:
  1. .agent/registry/active/ - New YAML task system
  2. .agent/registry/archive/legacy_learning_system/ - Old markdown system (deleted)
  3. Claude Code native tasks - Session-only, ephemeral
  4. Various *_TASK_REGISTRY.md files in docs/

  Target Architecture:
  - Single source of truth: .agent/registry/active/
  - Archive: .agent/registry/archive/
  - Opportunities inbox: .agent/registry/inbox/
  - Document in REGISTRY_OF_REGISTRIES.md

  Acceptance Criteria:
  - All persistent tasks in .agent/registry/active/
  - Legacy markdown registries marked as deprecated or removed
  - Clear documentation of the canonical task system
  - task_registry.py and boost_confidence.py point to correct paths

status: SCOPED
