id: TASK-003
title: Fix promote_opportunity.sh multiline bug
status: COMPLETE
description: |
  The bash-based promote_opportunity.sh uses grep to extract YAML fields,
  which fails for multiline descriptions.

  Root cause: grep only captures first line of multiline YAML values.

  Solution: Python version with proper YAML parsing (promote_opportunity.py).
