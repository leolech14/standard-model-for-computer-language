## Query

Is "Ever was, always been" an existing English expression or idiom? What are similar phrases that convey the idea of something being native/original to a system, as if it was always there from the beginning? Looking for phrases used in software engineering, design, or architecture contexts.

## Response

**No, "Ever was, always been" is not a recognized English expression or idiom.** Search results do not reference this exact phrase; "ever" functions as an adverb meaning "at any time," "always," or emphasizing continuity, often poetically for inherent traits, but no sources document this specific wording.[1][2][3]

### Similar Phrases Conveying Something Native/Original to a System
These phrases imply a feature, behavior, or element inherent "from the beginning" or fundamentally built-in. While search results focus on general English idioms with "ever" (e.g., "ever the gentleman" for unfailing traits, "ever-changing," "ever-present"),[3][4] the following are established idioms or terms commonly used in **software engineering, design, or architecture** contexts to evoke nativeness or primordial presence:

- **Baked in**: Describes a feature fundamentally integrated into the core design, as if always part of the system (e.g., "Security is baked in from day one").[inferred from common usage; aligns with "ever" as inherent character][2]
- **By design**: Indicates intentional, original inclusion rather than an accident (e.g., "The latency is by design in this architecture").
- **Core to / At the core of**: Emphasizes something central and original to the system's identity (e.g., "Modularity is at the core of microservices").
- **Hardwired / Hard-coded**: Refers to permanently embedded elements, unchangeable without major rework (e.g., "The parser is hardwired into the legacy codebase").
- **Inherent / In-built**: Directly conveys something native and unavoidable from inception (e.g., "State management is inherent in monolithic designs").
- **From the ground up**: Suggests built into the foundational structure (e.g., "The framework supports scalability from the ground up").

| Phrase          | Nuance in Tech Contexts                  | Example Usage |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------|---------------|
| **Baked in**   | Deeply integrated, non-optional         | "Concurrency is baked in to the language runtime." |
| **By design**  | Deliberately original, not emergent     | "Single-threaded behavior is by design." |
| **Hardwired**  | Fixed at low level, like hardware       | "Error handling is hardwired in the kernel." |
| **Inherent**   | Naturally arising from the system's nature | "Mutability is inherent in object-oriented paradigms." |

These align with "ever" connotations of timeless, character-defining presence (e.g., "ever busy" for perpetual traits).[2] No search results provide tech-specific idioms matching the query exactly, so the above draw from standard domain terminology.
