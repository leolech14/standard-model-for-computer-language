## Query

In formal mathematics, set theory, and computer science, what symbols and notation conventions are used to denote:

1. The UNIVERSAL SET (the complete set containing all elements under consideration)
2. The COMPLETE SET or TOTALITY of something
3. The CLOSURE of a set (all elements plus their limit points)
4. The POWER SET (all subsets)

Specifically looking for:
- Standard mathematical symbols (Unicode)
- Subscript/superscript conventions
- Common abbreviations in formal systems
- How type theory or category theory denotes "all of type X"

Provide the actual symbols, not just descriptions.

## Response

# Notation for Set-Theoretic Concepts

## 1. Universal Set

The **universal set** is denoted by **U** or **ε** (epsilon)[1][2]. In some contexts, particularly in theoretical work, **E** is also used[1]. The universal set contains all elements under consideration within a given context[1][3].

## 2. Complete Set or Totality

There is no single standardized symbol for "complete set" or "totality" across all mathematical contexts. The notation depends on context:

- **U** (universal set) when referring to all elements in a specific domain[1][3]
- **ℕ, ℤ, ℚ, ℝ, ℂ** for standard number systems (natural numbers, integers, rationals, reals, complex numbers)
- **Set-builder notation**: \(S = \{x \mid P(x)\}\) to define a complete set by property[1]
- **Blackboard bold letters** (ℝ, ℕ, etc.) in formal mathematics to denote standard universal structures

## 3. Closure of a Set

The **closure** of a set A is standardized as **Ā** (A with a bar/overline) or **cl(A)**[citation needed from search results]. This notation represents the set plus all its limit points.

## 4. Power Set

The **power set** of set A uses the following conventions:

- **𝒫(A)** or **P(A)** (calligraphic or regular P)[citation needed from search results]
- **2^A** (exponential notation, since a finite set with n elements has 2^n subsets)[citation needed from search results]

**Note:** The search results provided comprehensive information on universal set notation but limited details on closure and power set symbols. The symbols for closure and power set are standard in mathematical practice but are not fully documented in the provided sources. For formal type theory and category theory conventions regarding "all of type X," additional specialized resources beyond these results would be needed for complete accuracy.
