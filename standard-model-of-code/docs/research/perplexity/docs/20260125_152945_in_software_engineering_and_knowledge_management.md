## Query

In software engineering and knowledge management, validate this terminology proposal:

1. CODOME - The complete set of executable code in a project (source files, functions, classes). Analogous to 'genome' for genetics.

2. CONTEXTOME - The complete set of documentation, configuration, and AI-reasoning artifacts alongside code. Non-executable context that gives meaning.

3. PROJECTOME - The totality of a software project: Codome + Contextome + Visualization + Governance artifacts.

Questions:
- Are these terms already used in academic literature or industry?
- Is the '-ome' suffix appropriate for software engineering concepts?
- What existing terms overlap with these concepts (e.g., 'codebase', 'documentation corpus', 'project universe')?
- Would these terms be understood by software engineers without explanation?

## Response

**The proposed terms CODOME, CONTEXTOME, and PROJECTOME are not used in academic literature or industry based on available sources.** These glossaries and standards from IEEE, ISO, FDA, and various software engineering resources do not reference them, nor do they appear in definitions of software components, projects, or related concepts[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9].

**The '-ome' suffix is not standard or appropriate for software engineering concepts.** It originates from biology (e.g., genome for complete genetic material) to denote comprehensive sets, but software engineering terminology relies on precise, established terms like "codebase," "source code," or "software system" without biological analogies[1][2][3]. No sources apply '-ome' to code, documentation, or projects, potentially causing confusion by implying unestablished scientific completeness[1][2].

**Existing terms overlap significantly:**
- **CODOME** (executable code set): Matches **codebase** (complete source code repository), **source code** (program instructions in high-level language), or **program** (instructions and data for computation)[2][3][4].
- **CONTEXTOME** (documentation, config, AI artifacts): Aligns with **documentation** (descriptions for maintenance), **software** (includes programs, procedures, documentation, data), or **requirements** (needs and specs)[1][2][3].
- **PROJECTOME** (full project totality): Corresponds to **software system** (programs, docs, data for operation), **software engineering project** (design, implementation, testing, maintenance), or **SDLC** (full development lifecycle)[1][2][3][4].

**Software engineers would not understand these terms without explanation.** Established glossaries emphasize familiar terms like "code," "architecture," and "system" for clarity and interoperability; novel biological metaphors lack precedent and could hinder communication[1][2][3][4][5][6][7]. Sources stress standardized vocabulary (e.g., IEEE/ISO) to avoid ambiguity in development and maintenance[1][2].
