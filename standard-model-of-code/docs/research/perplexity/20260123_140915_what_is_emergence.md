## Query

What is emergence?

---

## Response

**Emergence** is a process in which complex systems develop properties or behaviors that their individual parts do not possess on their own, and that arise only through the interaction of those parts within a larger whole.[2] In simpler terms, the whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts.[1]

## Key Characteristics

Emergence has several defining features:

- **Novel properties**: The emergent properties are qualitatively new and cannot be easily traced back to or reduced to individual component parts.[1][4]
- **Irreducibility**: While emergent properties depend on the system's components, they cannot be fully explained or calculated by analyzing those components in isolation.[4]
- **Collective behavior**: Emergence describes what parts of a system do together that they would not do alone.[3]
- **Non-linear change**: Emergent outcomes arise through complex interactions rather than simple additive processes.[1]

## Examples

Emergence appears across many domains:[5]

- **Consciousness**: Requires a brain but is irreducible to brain structure alone, and actually changes the brain.[1]
- **Life**: An emergent property arising from interactions between body systems (cardiovascular, digestive, nervous, immune) that together produce something fundamentally different from their individual functions.[5]
- **Water properties**: Individual oxygen and hydrogen atoms have different properties than water molecules, which collectively form rivers and ocean waves.[3]
- **Social phenomena**: Traffic congestion, organizational culture, and social systems emerge from interactions among many individual agents.[5]

The concept traces back to Aristotle in philosophy and was formally named by G. H. Lewes in 1875.[4] Emergence plays a central role in understanding complex systems across biology, chemistry, physics, economics, and social domains.[2]
