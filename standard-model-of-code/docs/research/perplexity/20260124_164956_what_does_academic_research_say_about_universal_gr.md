## Query

What does academic research say about universal graph-theoretic properties of software systems? Specifically: (1) coupling and cohesion as measurable topological properties, (2) centrality and its correlation with defect rates, (3) cyclomatic complexity as invariant, (4) dependency graph topology patterns that appear across all codebases. Cite papers, metrics, and findings.

## Response

**No academic research on universal graph-theoretic properties of software dependency graphs is present in the provided search results.** All results [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8] focus exclusively on software architecture patterns for data processing pipelines (e.g., Lambda, Kappa, batch/stream processing) and continuous delivery pipelines, with no coverage of dependency graphs, coupling/cohesion metrics, centrality measures, cyclomatic complexity invariants, or topological patterns like small-world or scale-free networks.

### Addressing Each Question
1. **Quantifying coupling and cohesion as topological properties:** No methods, metrics, or theoretical bases (e.g., graph density, clustering coefficients) are discussed.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]
2. **Correlation between centrality measures and defect rates:** No studies, centrality types (e.g., betweenness, eigenvector), datasets, or statistical findings are mentioned.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]
3. **Invariant properties of cyclomatic complexity:** No observations across projects/languages, studies, or methodologies are covered.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]
4. **Recurring topological patterns:** No patterns (e.g., small-world, scale-free, motifs), studies, datasets, or techniques are identified.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]

**Search results appear mismatched to the query**, likely due to keyword overlap with "pipeline" in a software context. Relevant academic literature exists outside these results (e.g., studies on scale-free properties in software networks by Wheeldon & Counsell or defect prediction via betweenness centrality by Nagappan), but cannot be cited here without direct sourcing. Consider refining search terms like "software dependency graphs scale-free" or "graph theory coupling cohesion source code" for targeted academic retrieval.
