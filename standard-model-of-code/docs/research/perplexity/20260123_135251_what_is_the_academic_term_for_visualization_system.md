What is the academic term for visualization systems that compress semantic information into spatial representations?

## Response

**Spatialization** is the academic term for visualization systems that compress semantic information into spatial representations.

This process involves transforming abstract, non-spatial semantic data—such as relationships in networks or text—into structured 3D or 2D layouts to reveal patterns visually, often using techniques like graph layout algorithms based on spring metaphors.[2] For instance, systems visualizing WWW semantic content position nodes in space to expose structure, addressing the lack of inherent spatial analogs in semantic properties.[2] Related concepts appear in **semantic visualization**, which maps varied semantic content (e.g., news events or geospatial data) to visual metaphors and spatial forms for tasks like analysis and inference.[3] However, **spatialization** specifically denotes the creation of these spatial embeddings from semantics, distinct from purely linguistic spatial semantics or geographic representations.[1][4][5]
