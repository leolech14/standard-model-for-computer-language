First review cut required reading from 1,219 lines to 138 lines. Second review by fresh agent found new issues.\n\nISSUES FOUND:\n1. Conflicting boot instructions (old doc says boot.sh, new doc says ./concierge)\n2. Task inbox shows count (34 items) but no preview - agent can't prioritize\n3. No value proposition - agent doesn't know WHY the system matters\n4. Tutorial too skeletal (6 lines) vs theory docs (340+ lines)\n5. Physics metaphors (Wave/Particle/Observer for code/context/agent) add cognitive load\n6. Glossary overwhelming before first action\n\nProvide STRUCTURED DATA:\n\n1.
