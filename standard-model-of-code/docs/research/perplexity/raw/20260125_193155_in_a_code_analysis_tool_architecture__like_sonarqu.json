This handles large-scale data from diverse sources without silos, directly supporting batch stats like grade distributions or variance across repos.[2]\n- **Scalability for batch processing**: Data aggregation best practices emphasize centralized repositories or APIs for unifying multi-source data (e.g., from 500+ repos), with features like normalization, deduplication, batch/real-time collection, and scalability for growing volumes. A standalone tool (option A) risks fragmentation, while centralization avoids redundant infrastructure.[3]\n- **Integration with core analysis**: Platforms like Cycode consolidate scanners (SAST, SCA) into a centralized system for correlated findings, AI prioritization, and ASPM visibility. This mirrors placing batch stats alongside single-codebase stats in a **src/core/stats/** subsystem, promoting modular yet unified handling.[4]\n\n### Best Practices for Statistical Analysis Architecture\n- **Modular yet centralized design**: Adopt a framework like SCALe for aggregating tool outputs, with APIs for new integrations (e.g., SARIF format). Combine with incremental analysis on changed code to manage large codebases efficiently.[1][2]\n- **Core features for batch stats**:\n  - Prebuilt connectors for repo/codebase data ingestion.\n  - Normalization for consistent metrics (e.g., grades, variance).\n  - Scalable processing (parallel/incremental) for 500+ repos.\n  - Unified dashboard for golden repo selection and distributions.[3]\n- **Avoid silos**: Distributed systems best practices favor modular per-service analysis feeding into centralized pipelines, preventing bottlenecks in CI/CD while enabling cross-repo stats.[1]\n- **Limitations in results**: No sources directly address SonarQube/CodeClimate stats architectures, but patterns from SCALe and Cycode indicate centralization outperforms standalone for enterprise-scale aggregation. For polyglot/large repos, ensure multi-language support in the central subsystem.[1][2]"
