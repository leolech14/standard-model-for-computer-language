This is a collection of accessible web components that follow VS Code's design language and can be integrated into web-based projects[4]. The toolkit includes components like buttons, dropdowns, radio buttons, checkboxes, and others[4].\n\nImportantly, the Webview UI Toolkit now offers **React-wrapped versions** of all components, allowing you to import them directly into React projects:\n\n```javascript\nimport {\n  VSCodeButton,\n  VSCodeDropdown,\n  VSCodeRadio,\n  VSCodeCheckbox,\n} from '@vscode/webview-ui-toolkit/react'\n```\n\nThe underlying technology uses **FAST**, a Microsoft project that powers the web components[4]. The toolkit requires no special configuration and works out of the box[4].\n\n## Limitations of Current Search Results\n\nThe search results provided focus primarily on the Webview UI Toolkit and don't contain detailed information about:\n\n- Monroe Editor and its relationship to VS Code\n- Whether VS Code uses React, Vue, or custom frameworks internally\n- Availability of specific VS Code UI elements like the sidebar, command palette, or tree views as standalone components\n- Other community projects packaging VS Code components\n\nTo fully answer your remaining questions about Monaco Editor, VS Code's internal architecture, and alternative component libraries, you would need additional sources beyond these search results.\n\nFor your Three.js visualization app, the Webview UI Toolkit appears to be the most directly supported approach for professional-grade VS Code-styled UI components in a browser environment."
