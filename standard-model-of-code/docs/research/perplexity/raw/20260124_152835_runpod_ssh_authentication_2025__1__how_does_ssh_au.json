          "content": "RunPod SSH authentication uses **key-based authentication** as its primary method, though password authentication can be enabled as an alternative.[1]\n\n## How SSH Authentication Works\n\nRunPod authenticates SSH connections entirely through **SSH key pairs** rather than passwords.[1] When you connect to a Pod, RunPod's systems verify that you possess the corresponding private key to your uploaded public key. This is more secure than password-based authentication and is the standard method for Pod access.[1]\n\n## Do You Need to Upload an SSH Public Key?\n\nYes. To use SSH with RunPod, you must:**[1]\n\n1. Generate an SSH key pair on your local machine using `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"[email protected]\"`\n2. Retrieve your public key from `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`\n3. Add the public key to the **SSH Public Keys** field in your RunPod user account settings\n\nRunPod will automatically inject these keys into all Pods you create.[1] Alternatively, you can override the default public key for a specific Pod by setting the `SSH_PUBLIC_KEY` environment variable.[1]\n\n## Password Authentication\n\nWhile RunPod's default configuration doesn't require passwords, **password authentication can be enabled** on a Pod.[4][5] You can set a root password and modify the SSH configuration file to allow password-based connections, though this is less secure than key-based authentication.[4]\n\nAdditionally, there are community scripts available that enable dual authentication (both SSH key and password methods).[5]\n\n## Setting SSH Key via API When Creating a Pod\n\nThe search results don't explicitly document an API method for setting the SSH key during Pod creation. However, you can set the `RUNPOD_SSH_PUBLIC_KEY` (or `SSH_PUBLIC_KEY`) environment variable on a running Pod to inject a new public key, which will cause the Pod to restart.[3]\n\n## Alternatives to SSH for Running Commands\n\nThe search results provided don't include information about an exec API or other alternative methods for running commands on RunPod Pods beyond SSH. To get comprehensive information about RunPod's API capabilities for command execution, you would need to consult RunPod's full API documentation, which isn't included in these search results."
