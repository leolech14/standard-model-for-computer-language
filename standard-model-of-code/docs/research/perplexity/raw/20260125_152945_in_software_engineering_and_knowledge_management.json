Analogous to 'genome' for genetics.\n\n2. CONTEXTOME - The complete set of documentation, configuration, and AI-reasoning artifacts alongside code. Non-executable context that gives meaning.\n\n3. PROJECTOME - The totality of a software project: Codome + Contextome + Visualization + Governance artifacts.\n\nQuestions:\n- Are these terms already used in academic literature or industry?\n- Is the '-ome' suffix appropriate for software engineering concepts?\n- What existing terms overlap with these concepts (e.g., 'codebase', 'documentation corpus', 'project universe')?\n- Would these terms be understood by software engineers without explanation?",

No sources apply '-ome' to code, documentation, or projects, potentially causing confusion by implying unestablished scientific completeness[1][2].\n\n**Existing terms overlap significantly:**\n- **CODOME** (executable code set): Matches **codebase** (complete source code repository), **source code** (program instructions in high-level language), or **program** (instructions and data for computation)[2][3][4].\n- **CONTEXTOME** (documentation, config, AI artifacts): Aligns with **documentation** (descriptions for maintenance), **software** (includes programs, procedures, documentation, data), or **requirements** (needs and specs)[1][2][3].\n- **PROJECTOME** (full project totality): Corresponds to **software system** (programs, docs, data for operation), **software engineering project** (design, implementation, testing, maintenance), or **SDLC** (full development lifecycle)[1][2][3][4].\n\n**Software engineers would not understand these terms without explanation.** Established glossaries emphasize familiar terms like \"code,\" \"architecture,\" and \"system\" for clarity and interoperability; novel biological metaphors lack precedent and could hinder communication[1][2][3][4][5][6][7]. Sources stress standardized vocabulary (e.g., IEEE/ISO) to avoid ambiguity in development and maintenance[1][2]."
