    "query": "We are building a code analysis framework with THREE topology models that need integration validation:\n\n**Model 1: SCALE as IN/OUT Axis**\n- 16 levels from Bit (L-3) to Universe (L12)\n- NOT a vertical hierarchy but an INTERNAL/EXTERNAL axis\n- Internal (Bit→Function): code-proximal, self-contained\n- External (Project→Universe): context-dependent, world knowledge\n- Boundary at Project/Workspace level\n- Analogy: RG flow in physics (UV→IR)\n\n**Model 2: Codome Landscape**\n- Code exists on navigable terrain\n- Elevation = complexity\n- Gradients = difficulty slopes\n- Betti numbers for topological features (cycles, holes)\n- Codespace is hyperbolic, fractal, non-Euclidean\n- Has wormholes (callbacks, events) and caves (hidden complexity)\n\n**Model 3: Purpose Field Funnel**\n- Purpose Field 𝒫 is a vector field over code nodes\n- Shape across 16 levels: FOCUSING FUNNEL\n- At L0 (Bit): diffuse, no clear purpose\n- At L12 (Universe): sharp, single unified purpose\n- Magnitude grows exponentially going UP\n- Direction variance decreases exponentially going UP\n- Analogy: Renormalization Group flow\n\n**QUESTIONS:**\n1. Are these three models mathematically COMPATIBLE or do they contradict each other?\n2. How does the IN/OUT axis (internal/external) relate to the PURPOSE FUNNEL (diffuse/focused)?\n3. Can the LANDSCAPE terrain metaphor unify both?\n4. What unified topology would integrate all three perspectives?\n5. What academic fields study multi-axis topologies like this (internal/external + complexity + purpose)?",
