          "content": "# Gamut Clipping Detection and Quantification\n\nDetecting and quantifying gamut clipping magnitude involves determining how far an out-of-gamut color lies from the valid color space boundary. The standard approach uses **hue-preserving projection** combined with distance calculations in perceptually uniform color spaces.\n\n## Core Algorithm: Hue-Preserving Projection\n\nThe most efficient method, as detailed in modern color science, treats gamut clipping as a 2D problem in lightness-chroma space for a fixed hue[1]. The algorithm works by:\n\n1. **Mapping to OKLAB/OKLch space**: Convert your OKLCH color to OKLAB, which provides a perceptually uniform foundation[1].\n\n2. **Finding the gamut boundary**: The sRGB gamut boundary at a constant hue approximates a **triangular shape** with corners at specific lightness and chroma values[1]. The critical point is the \"cusp\"—the point of maximum saturation for a given hue.\n\n3. **Locating the cusp**: Use **polynomial curve fitting** followed by one iteration of **Halley's method** to find the cusp coordinates (L_cusp, C_cusp) for your hue angle[1][2]. This gives error less than 10^-6 for most hues.\n\n4. **Projecting to the boundary**: Draw a straight line from the center of the gamut (achromatic axis) through your out-of-gamut color until it intersects the gamut boundary[1][2]. This intersection point becomes your clipped color while preserving hue.\n\n## Measuring Clipping Distance\n\nThe **clipping distance** can be quantified as the **chroma difference** between your original color and the clipped result:\n\n- In OKLCH space: Simply calculate the difference in chroma values before and after gamut mapping\n- In perceptual terms: This represents how much saturation was lost during the mapping process[1][2]\n\nAlternatively, you can measure distance in **OKLAB space** using Euclidean distance:\n\n$$\\text{ClippingDistance} = \\sqrt{(\\Delta L)^2 + (\\Delta a)^2 + (\\Delta b)^2}$$\n\nwhere the differences are between the original OKLCH→OKLAB values and the clipped OKLAB result.\n\n## Implementation Considerations\n\nFor the cusp calculation, use **three separate polynomial approximations** corresponding to the three sRGB clipping boundaries (when R=0, G=0, or B=0)[2]. The algorithm selects the appropriate polynomial by testing which produces the minimum value, effectively choosing the closest boundary curve[2].\n\nThis approach balances **computational efficiency** with **perceptual accuracy**: it avoids iteratively testing every possible color by directly computing the intersection point through mathematical approximation rather than brute-force search[1].\n\n## CSS Color 4 Context\n\nWhile the search results don't explicitly detail CSS Color 4's standardized measurement approach, this hue-preserving projection method in OKLCH aligns with modern color science best practices for gamut mapping, as it minimizes visible hue shift—the most objectionable artifact of naive RGB clamping[2]."
