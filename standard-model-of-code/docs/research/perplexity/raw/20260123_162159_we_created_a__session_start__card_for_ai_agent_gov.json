Load project CLAUDE.md (architecture, commands)\n2. Load AGENT_KERNEL.md (session rules, non-negotiables)\n3. Check active sprint from registry\n4. Scan inbox for pending opportunities\n5. Initialize session state file\n6. Display Decision Deck with available actions\n\n**Academic question:** Is there established research on:\n1. The effectiveness of forced initialization sequences in multi-agent systems?\n2. 'Primacy effect' patterns in AI/LLM context priming?\n3. State machine patterns where agents must complete initialization before receiving commands?\n\nLooking for academic/industry validation of this pattern beyond our earlier GOAP/Behavior Trees research.",

          "content": "**No established research directly validates forced initialization sequences as the first action in multi-agent systems, but related work exists on priming and state initialization patterns.** Primacy effects are well-documented in LLMs, supporting your pattern's use for embedding context early. State machine patterns requiring initialization before commands are common in agent architectures but lack specific studies on enforcement efficacy.\n\n### 1. Effectiveness of Forced Initialization Sequences in Multi-Agent Systems\nNo search results identify research on **forced initialization sequences** (e.g., mandatory loading of context files before work) specifically in multi-agent systems. Related concepts appear in agent design:\n- Multi-agent systems often use initialization phases for coordination, but studies focus on voluntary bootstrapping rather than enforced primacy.[3] (context priming in memory tasks)\n- Industry practices in AI governance imply initialization for safety (e.g., loading rules), but academic validation is absent beyond general GOAP/Behavior Trees, which you noted.\n\nLimitations: Results emphasize human/LLM psychology over multi-agent enforcement; further domain-specific searches (e.g., arXiv on \"agent initialization protocols\") may yield more.\n\n### 2. Primacy Effect Patterns in AI/LLM Context Priming\n**Yes, multiple studies confirm the primacy effect in LLMs, where early-presented information strongly influences outputs, validating your use for embedding mental models via first interactions.[1][5][6]**\n- Fine-tuning amplifies primacy bias, as early items receive deeper processing; reordering options by query similarity exploits this to boost MCQA accuracy by up to significant margins.[1]\n- Experiments on ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude (repurposing Asch 1946) show preference for positive-first descriptions when presented simultaneously, but shifts (e.g., negative-first preference) in separate prompts—indicating context order matters for priming.[5][6]\n- This aligns with human memory: early info transfers to long-term storage with less interference, enhancing recall and interpretation of later data.[2][4][7]\n\nYour 'Session Start' leverages this by prioritizing CLAUDE.md and AGENT_KERNEL.md loading.\n\n### 3. State Machine Patterns Requiring Initialization Before Commands\n**Yes, state machines in AI agents routinely enforce initialization states before operational commands, though research focuses on design rather than forced efficacy studies.[3]**\n- Agents transition via explicit states (e.g., init → ready → execute), preventing commands until initialization completes—common in reinforcement learning and robotics to ensure safe context loading.\n- Retrieval interference theory shows context shifts induce primacy (early-learned behaviors dominate), supporting mandatory early loading over later overrides.[3]\n- No direct multi-agent studies on \"non-negotiable\" initialization, but patterns mirror sensory preconditioning where pre-training embeds priors before task learning.[3]\n\n| Aspect | Supporting Evidence | Relevance to Your Pattern |\n|--------|---------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Primacy in LLMs** | Order affects preference/bias[1][5][6] | Forces critical context first for mental model embedding |\n| **Memory/Context Shifts** | Early info less context-dependent[3] | Ensures rules persist despite later inputs |\n| **UX/Design Analogy** | Prime key info at start for retention[2][4] | Parallels agent \"inbox scan\" after core loads |\n\nThis pattern gains indirect validation from LLM biases and state machine norms, suggesting effectiveness for governance."
