The results focus exclusively on semantic chunking for **natural language documents** (research papers, articles, novels, technical documentation) rather than **source code**. None of the results address code-specific semantic chunking, semantic tagging schemas for code, incremental indexing of codebases, or academic work on code boundary detection from 2024-2026.\n\nThe search results cover general chunking principles—such as embedding-based similarity detection and threshold-based chunk boundaries[1][2][3]—that *could* theoretically apply to code, but they don't discuss:\n\n- Code-specific parsing or Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) considerations\n- Compact tagging schemas designed for code segments\n- Incremental indexing strategies for evolving codebases\n- Code dependency representation methods\n- Academic papers or tools from 2024-2026 addressing these problems\n\n**What would help:** A search specifically targeting:\n- \"Semantic chunking source code\" or \"code segmentation AST\"\n- \"Code tagging schema\" or \"semantic metadata code indexing\"\n- \"Incremental code indexing\" combined with 2024-2026 date filters\n- \"Code dependency graphs\" and semantic indexing\n- Academic venues (ICSE, FSE, ASE) from recent years on code understanding and retrieval\n\nYour use case—building Semantic Chunk Records (SCRs) with type codes, summaries, entities, and dependencies for LLM consumption—is specialized and likely requires domain-specific research or industry tools not captured in these results."
