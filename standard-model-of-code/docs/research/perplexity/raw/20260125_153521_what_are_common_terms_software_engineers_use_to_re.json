Engineers say \"my project has 1,045 files\" to mean everything under this root.[1]\n- **Repository** (or **repo**): In Git-based workflows, the full clone or working copy with **all committed files** across branches, used in CI/CD pipelines (e.g., \"lint all files in the repo\"). This emphasizes completeness as the version-controlled totality.[5] (inferred from common Git practices)\n- **Source tree**: Describes the hierarchical **complete set of source files and assets**, including non-code, often in build systems like Make or Bazel to glob \"everything in the tree.\"[1]\n\n### Usage in Build Systems, CI/CD, and Project Management\nThese terms appear in tools emphasizing **all files** for totality:\n\n| Context | Term | Description and Example |\n|---------|------|-------------------------|\n| **Build systems** (e.g., Maven, Gradle) | Project | Root with **all sources, resources, configs**; e.g., `mvn compile` builds everything in the project.[2] |\n| **CI/CD** (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins) | Repository / Workspace | Pipeline checks out the **full repo** (code + docs + tests) for linting, testing; e.g., \"scan all files in workspace.\"[2][5] |\n| **Project management** (e.g., monorepos) | Monorepo | Single repo with **complete collection** of all project files across services/docs; implies total scope.[1] |\n| **Version control** (e.g., Git) | Working tree | Current **full set of tracked files** on disk, including uncommitted changes.[1] |\n\nLess common but related: **file structure** (interchangeable with hierarchy, covering **all elements** logically).[1] In regulated contexts like FDA software, a **data dictionary** catalogs **all files/data elements** but doesn't name the collection itself.[6]\n\nFor your example (\"all 1,045 source files across code, docs, config, and governance artifacts\"), engineers would say: **\"all files in the project/repo\"** or **\"the entire project directory\"**—precise, total, and standard across teams.[1][2]"
