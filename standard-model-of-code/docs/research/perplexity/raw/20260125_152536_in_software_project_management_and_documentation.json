Key steps from best practices:\n\n- **Audit and inventory**: Catalog all 6+ docs, identify overlaps/duplicates, map content (e.g., concerns → priorities → status), and define ownership.[2][4]\n- **Choose/design unified structure**: Select one platform (e.g., central Markdown repo, Confluence, or docs-as-code hub) with templates, standardized formats, taxonomy/tagging, and version control. Keep it minimal—document only essentials to avoid bloat.[1][3][5]\n- **Migrate phased**: Start with simple content; reuse existing info via links/references (not copies) to avoid duplication. Update originals to be the source; delete redundants post-migration.[2][6]\n- **Govern ongoing**: Implement workflows (reviews, auto-sync if needed), role-based access, training, and audits. Establish style guides for consistency.[1][2][5]\n\n| Approach | Pros | Cons | Expert Examples |\n|----------|------|------|-----------------|\n| **A: New summary doc** | Quick overview | Adds sprawl, sync issues, outdated risks[2][6] | Avoided; leads to \"maintenance nightmare\"[6] |\n| **B: Update/delete to one authoritative** | Single truth, 40-75% efficiency gains, no duplicates[2] | Upfront migration effort | Unified platforms cut tool-switching 75%, comms overhead 50%[2]; hubs republish without forcing process changes[5] |\n\n### Outcomes from Real Cases\n- **75% tool reduction, 40% faster creation** via single platform with migration steps.[2]\n- **50% less inter-team comms**, eliminated duplicates via unified taxonomy.[2]\n- **Central hubs** (e.g., Drupal/Backstage) allow team autonomy while providing one portal—republish from sources, don't summarize.[5]\n- **Content reuse + single truth** prevents scattered info; focus docs on context/decisions.[3][6]\n\nIf your 6 docs are in a Git repo, evolve REPO_TRUTH.md into the sole tracker: migrate data there, delete others, and use Git for versioning. For larger scale, consider tools like a developer portal for federated search if full merge isn't feasible initially.[5] This reduces sprawl long-term while maintaining accuracy."
