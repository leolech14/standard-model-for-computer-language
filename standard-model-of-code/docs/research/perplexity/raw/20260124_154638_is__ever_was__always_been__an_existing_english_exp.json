          "content": "**No, \"Ever was, always been\" is not a recognized English expression or idiom.** Search results do not reference this exact phrase; \"ever\" functions as an adverb meaning \"at any time,\" \"always,\" or emphasizing continuity, often poetically for inherent traits, but no sources document this specific wording.[1][2][3]\n\n### Similar Phrases Conveying Something Native/Original to a System\nThese phrases imply a feature, behavior, or element inherent \"from the beginning\" or fundamentally built-in. While search results focus on general English idioms with \"ever\" (e.g., \"ever the gentleman\" for unfailing traits, \"ever-changing,\" \"ever-present\"),[3][4] the following are established idioms or terms commonly used in **software engineering, design, or architecture** contexts to evoke nativeness or primordial presence:\n\n- **Baked in**: Describes a feature fundamentally integrated into the core design, as if always part of the system (e.g., \"Security is baked in from day one\").[inferred from common usage; aligns with \"ever\" as inherent character][2]\n- **By design**: Indicates intentional, original inclusion rather than an accident (e.g., \"The latency is by design in this architecture\").\n- **Core to / At the core of**: Emphasizes something central and original to the system's identity (e.g., \"Modularity is at the core of microservices\").\n- **Hardwired / Hard-coded**: Refers to permanently embedded elements, unchangeable without major rework (e.g., \"The parser is hardwired into the legacy codebase\").\n- **Inherent / In-built**: Directly conveys something native and unavoidable from inception (e.g., \"State management is inherent in monolithic designs\").\n- **From the ground up**: Suggests built into the foundational structure (e.g., \"The framework supports scalability from the ground up\").\n\n| Phrase          | Nuance in Tech Contexts                  | Example Usage |\n|-----------------|------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| **Baked in**   | Deeply integrated, non-optional         | \"Concurrency is baked in to the language runtime.\" |\n| **By design**  | Deliberately original, not emergent     | \"Single-threaded behavior is by design.\" |\n| **Hardwired**  | Fixed at low level, like hardware       | \"Error handling is hardwired in the kernel.\" |\n| **Inherent**   | Naturally arising from the system's nature | \"Mutability is inherent in object-oriented paradigms.\" |\n\nThese align with \"ever\" connotations of timeless, character-defining presence (e.g., \"ever busy\" for perpetual traits).[2] No search results provide tech-specific idioms matching the query exactly, so the above draw from standard domain terminology."
