P = C ∪ X (Projectome is union of Codome and Contextome)\n2. X = P \\ C (Contextome is Projectome minus Codome - set difference)\n3. C = P \\ X (Codome is Projectome minus Contextome)\n4. C ∩ X = ∅ (Codome and Contextome are disjoint - no overlap)\n\nQuestions:\n1. Is this a valid PARTITION of set P into two subsets?\n2. Are the formulas mathematically consistent?\n3. Is there a simpler or more standard notation for this relationship?\n4. What is the formal term for when two sets are disjoint and their union equals the whole (exhaustive and mutually exclusive)?",

Alternatives include:\n- **Partition notation**: P = C ⊔ X (disjoint union symbol), emphasizing the partition property.\n- **Logical shorthand**: C ⊢ P ⊢ X (C and X form a partition of P), common in formal taxonomy validation[1][2].\n\n### Formal Term\n**Partition** (or \"set partition\"): A collection of nonempty, disjoint subsets whose union equals the whole set (mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive, or MECE)[1][2]. This matches criteria like **exhaustiveness** (comprehensiveness: all elements covered) and **exclusiveness** (no overlap), as validated in taxonomy literature[1]."
