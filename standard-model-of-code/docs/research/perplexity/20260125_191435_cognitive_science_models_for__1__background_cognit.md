## Query

Cognitive science models for: 1) Background cognitive processing / subconscious rumination as integration mechanism 2) Self-reflection systems that look both inward (memory, RAG-like retrieval) and outward (perception, search) 3) The 'event horizon' metaphor - boundary between internal model and external reality 4) How minds integrate internal knowledge with external information in continuous background process 5) Dual-process theory (System 1 vs System 2) applied to knowledge systems. Looking for formal models of how reflective systems maintain coherence between internal state and external world.

## Response

I appreciate the sophistication of your query, but I must be transparent: the search results provided do not contain information addressing most of your specific theoretical interests.

## What the Search Results Cover

The available results focus narrowly on **rumination as a pathological cognitive process** rather than the broader cognitive science models you're seeking. They establish that rumination involves:

- **Repetitive negative thinking** characterized by narrowly focused, self-referential cognition[1]
- **Impaired concentration and reduced sensitivity to contextual cues**[2], suggesting rumination as a constraint on normal information integration
- **Multiple mechanistic models** (Response Style Theory, S-REF model, stress-reactive models) that differ in their treatment of triggers, content, and metacognitive involvement[3]

The research does touch on one adjacent concept: rumination as a form of **constrained mind-wandering** with maladaptive memory retrieval patterns[1], which relates tangentially to your interest in background cognitive processing.

## Critical Gap

Your query requests formal models addressing:
1. Subconscious rumination as an *integration mechanism* (not pathological)
2. Bidirectional self-reflection systems (internal memory + external perception)
3. Event horizon metaphors (internal/external boundaries)
4. Continuous knowledge integration processes
5. Dual-process theory applied to coherence maintenance

**None of these topics appear in the provided search results.** These would require literature from:
- Computational cognitive modeling (beyond the mechanistic model in [1])
- Predictive processing and active inference frameworks
- Metacognitive theory beyond emotional disorders
- Systems neuroscience on information integration
- Formal epistemology on belief-reality alignment

The search results examine rumination as dysfunction rather than as a case study for understanding normal cognitive integration mechanisms.
