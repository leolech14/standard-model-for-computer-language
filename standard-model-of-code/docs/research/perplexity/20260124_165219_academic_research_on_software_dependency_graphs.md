## Query

Academic research on software dependency graphs: (1) scale-free networks in software by Wheeldon and Counsell, (2) betweenness centrality predicting defects by Nagappan Microsoft Research, (3) coupling metrics CBO RFC by Chidamber Kemerer 1994, (4) evidence that high coupling increases change propagation cost. Cite papers and statistical findings.

## Response

I cannot find evidence in the provided search results for most of the specific research topics you've referenced. The search results do not contain papers or findings from Wheeldon and Counsell on scale-free networks in software dependency graphs, Nagappan's research on betweenness centrality and defects, or empirical studies on change propagation costs related to high coupling.

However, the search results do address one of your four topics:

## Coupling Metrics and Software Quality

**CBO (Coupling Between Object classes) shows limited predictive value for defects.** In a study analyzing 275 release versions of 39 Java projects, researchers found that "CBO, do not bring significant improvements to the models" for defect prediction and ranked among the worst-performing metrics.[2] The same study noted that "metrics CBO, CD, and NPM were" the lowest-performing across projects.[2]

The research identified **higher-performing alternatives to CBO**: NOC (Number of Children), NPA (Number of Public Attributes), DIT (Depth of Inheritance Tree), and LCOM5 (Lack of Cohesion in Methods) "were consistently ranked as the best across all projects."[2]

For **maintainability assessment**, the search results indicate that metrics-based models can support "buy-versus-build decisions, pre- and post-reengineering analysis, subcomponent quality analysis" and help "identify fault-prone components,"[1] but the results do not specifically validate RFC or provide empirical evidence linking CBO/RFC to maintainability or change propagation costs.

To address your specific research questions about scale-free properties, betweenness centrality, and change propagation, you would need additional academic sources beyond these search results. I recommend searching databases like IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, or Google Scholar directly for the Wheeldon and Counsell, Nagappan, and Chidamber-Kemerer citations you referenced.
