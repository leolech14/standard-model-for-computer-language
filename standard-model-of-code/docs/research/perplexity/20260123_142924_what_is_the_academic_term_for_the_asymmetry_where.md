## Query

What is the academic term for the asymmetry where abstraction is bounded below but unbounded above?

## Response

I cannot find an established academic term in the search results or standard computer science literature that specifically names the asymmetry you're describing—where abstraction is bounded below but unbounded above.

Based on the provided search results, which focus on Python coding standards (PEP 8), object-oriented design practices, and code documentation conventions, there is no direct reference to such a formal term.

However, this concept relates to several established ideas in computer science:

**Related Concepts:**
- **Abstraction levels** are discussed in the PySCF documentation[1], which describes hierarchical organization (from low-level handlers like `gto.Mole` to high-level post-Hartree-Fock objects), but without naming an asymmetric bound.
- **Layered architecture** in software design follows similar patterns where lower layers are more constrained (e.g., operating system calls) while upper layers can be more flexible.

**In the context of your "Standard Model of Code" project:** The three-plane model (Physical, Virtual, Semantic) you describe in MODEL.md suggests a similar hierarchy, but the documentation doesn't explicitly name this asymmetry property.

To identify or validate a specific academic term for this concept, you would likely need to:
1. Consult formal computer science theory papers on abstraction hierarchies
2. Review complexity theory or category theory literature
3. Check specialized publications on software architecture patterns

If this is a term you've encountered elsewhere, I'd recommend verifying it against peer-reviewed sources in formal methods or theoretical computer science, as it doesn't appear in standard Python or general software engineering documentation.
