      "content": "Based on the provided ACI (Adaptive Context Intelligence) modules and configuration, here is the analysis of the **PERPLEXITY** tier.\n\n*Note: The actual execution script `analyze.py` is not in the provided context, so the execution steps are inferred from the routing logic and configuration definitions.*\n\n### 1. What happens when ACI routes to PERPLEXITY tier?\n*   **Detection:** The `query_analyzer.py` detects **External Scope** via keywords (e.g., \"best practice\", \"latest\", \"vs\", \"2026\") defined in `aci_config.yaml`.\n*   **Routing:** `tier_router.py` returns a `RoutingDecision` object with:\n    *   `tier`: **Tier.PERPLEXITY**\n    *   `fallback_tier`: **Tier.LONG_CONTEXT** (if the API fails).\n    *   `reasoning`: e.g., \"External scope - defaulting to Perplexity\".\n*   **Configuration:** The system prepares to use the `sonar-pro` model with a temperature of `0.1` (defined in `aci_config.yaml`).\n\n### 2. Are the selected context sets used in any way?\n*   **In Router:** Yes, `tier_router.py` *still calculates* `primary_sets` (usually defaults to `['theory']` or broad architectural sets if semantic matching occurs).\n*   **In Execution:** **No (Likely).** Standard Perplexity API implementations rely on the model's internal knowledge and live web search. The local context sets (files from your repo) are typically **not** sent to Perplexity because:\n    1.  The tier is designed for *external* knowledge.\n    2.  Perplexity is a search engine, not a RAG over your codebase.\n    3.  Sending thousands of lines of local code to a web search API is inefficient and often privacy-violating.\n\n### 3. Current flow from query to Perplexity API call\n1.  **Input:** User enters a query (e.g., \"What is the latest React state of the art?\").\n2.  **Analysis:** `analyze_query()` flags it as `QueryScope.EXTERNAL`.\n3.  **Routing:** `route_query()` outputs `Tier.PERPLEXITY`.\n4.  **Execution (in analyze.py):**\n    *   The script sees `decision.tier == Tier.PERPLEXITY`.\n    *   It bypasses the local context loading/token counting logic.\n    *   It retrieves the API key and config (model `sonar-pro`).\n    *   It sends the **raw user query** directly to the Perplexity API.\n\n### 4. Where would context injection logically fit?\nIf you want Perplexity to understand your codebase context (e.g., \"Compare *my architecture* to industry standards\"), injection fits here:\n\n*   **Location:** In `analyze.py`, immediately **after** receiving the `RoutingDecision` and **before** the API call.\n*   **Strategy:**\n    *   Take the `primary_sets` identified by the router.\n    *   Generate a **High-Level Summary** of those sets (not the raw code).\n    *   **Prefix the Query:** Construct a prompt like:\n        > \"Context: I am working on a Python project using DDD and ACI. [Insert Summary].\n        > Question: [User Query]\"\n*   **Benefit:** This creates \"Grounded Research\" where external search results are filtered by relevance to your specific architectural context."
