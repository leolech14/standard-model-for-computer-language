      "content": "GraphRAG Implementation Plan Validation:\n\nCONTEXT: We need to build semantic proximity graph + GraphRAG for PROJECT_elements.\n\nCURRENT STATE:\n- 2,673 semantic chunks (539K tokens) from code\n- 1,068 research files (14 MB, Gemini + Perplexity)\n- 281 theories cataloged\n- Text search works (./pe refinery search)\n- NO graph structure yet\n\nPROPOSED PLAN (8 tasks, 27 hours):\n1. Install Neo4j (15min)\n2. Extract entities from chunks via Gemini (8h)\n3. Build graph: nodes + edges via cosine similarity >0.75 (4h)\n4. Community detection via Louvain (1h)\n5. GraphRAG query interface (5h)\n6. Visualization (Gephi + D3.js) (3h)\n7. Integrate 1,068 research files (4h)\n8. Validate accuracy vs text search (2h)\n\nRESEARCH FINDINGS:\n- GraphRAG: 56.2% accuracy vs Vector-only: 16.7% (3.4\u00d7 improvement)\n- Best for multi-entity, schema-intensive queries\n- Neo4j + LlamaIndex + LangGraph recommended stack\n- Louvain algorithm O(n log n), scales to billions\n\nVALIDATION QUESTIONS:\n1. Is this implementation sequence correct for our architecture?\n2. Should we use different tech stack given our existing refinery infrastructure?\n3. Entity extraction: Gemini batch vs streaming? Rate limit considerations?\n4. Graph schema: What node types and relationship types for theory + code + research?\n5. Integration with existing ./pe commands: how to expose GraphRAG queries?\n6. Performance expectations: 50K nodes realistic for Neo4j on Mac?\n7. Should we build incrementally (start with theories only, add code later)?\n8. Risks: What could go wrong? How to mitigate?\n\nProvide: Implementation roadmap validation, technology choices critique, schema recommendations, integration patterns with existing refinery/chunks, risk assessment, step-by-step execution plan."
