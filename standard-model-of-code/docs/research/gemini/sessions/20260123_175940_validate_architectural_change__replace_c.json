Concept: events accumulate activation energy, fire when pattern stabilizes (low energy state), composition rules (event A + event B triggers process C). Benefits: eliminates thundering herd, natural coherence. Question: What are the risks, implementation complexity, and prior art in event-driven architectures? Give confidence score."
