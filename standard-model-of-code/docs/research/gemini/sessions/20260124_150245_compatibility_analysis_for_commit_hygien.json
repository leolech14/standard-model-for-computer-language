GitButler (virtual branches, agent hooks)\n3. Pre-commit + commitlint (enforce standards)\n4. OpenCommit (AI commit messages)\n5. Git Worktrees (isolated agent directories)\n6. Aider (auto-commits per change)\n\nQUESTION: Which solution is MOST COMPATIBLE with our specific stack and also a NO-BRAINER fix? Consider:\n- Claude Code CLI hooks integration\n- VSCode/Antigravity compatibility\n- Fits the card game / task registry metaphor\n- Works with Wave/Particle separation\n- Minimal friction for onboarding new agents\n\nGive a single recommendation with justification."
