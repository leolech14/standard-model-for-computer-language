      "content": "Based on the provided codebase context, specifically the status of **TASK-018**, the Decision Deck integration is **INCOMPLETE and ABANDONED**.\n\nThe feature was marked **WONT_DO** on 2026-01-23 because it was determined to be \"Spec theater\" that added meta-complexity without being used.\n\nHere is the validation analysis against your specific checks:\n\n### Executive Status: ABANDONED (TASK-018)\nThe Decision Deck infrastructure exists as \"dead code\" (YAML definitions and specifications) but lacks the operational binding (Python execution logic) to function.\n\n| Check | Status | Evidence/Reasoning |\n|-------|--------|-------------------|\n| **1) Is session.yaml gitignored?** | \u26a0\ufe0f **Unverified** | Context for `.gitignore` is missing. However, `CARD-SES-001` creates `.agent/state/session.yaml`. If the feature was abandoned, this file likely doesn't exist or isn't being managed. |\n| **2) Is agent_session set registered?** | \u274c **No** | `analysis_sets.yaml` is not in the context, but TASK-018 lists `play_card.py` (the execution engine) as **Pending**. Without the engine, there is no mechanism to utilize a specific analysis set for the deck. |\n| **3) Can ACI route to session context?** | \u274c **No** | `SUBSYSTEM_INTEGRATION.md` does not list the Decision Deck/Session State as a data source for `analyze.py` (ACI). The integration was never built. |\n| **4) Are meters updated?** | \u274c **No** | The Logic to update meters (`play_card.py`) is listed as **Pending** in TASK-018 deliverables. Only the YAML file (`meters.yaml`) exists, but it is static. |\n\n---\n\n### Critical Gaps (If reviving)\n\nIf you intend to reverse the **WONT_DO** decision and revive this feature, the following gaps must be addressed:\n\n1.  **Missing Execution Engine (`play_card.py`)**\n    *   **Current State:** Only `deal_cards.py` (the query side) was implemented.\n    *   **Gap:** No script exists to actually \"play\" a card, perform the side effects (updating meters, creating files), and log the outcome.\n\n2.  **Missing ACI Integration**\n    *   **Current State:** `analyze.py` acts independently of the Deck.\n    *   **Gap:** `analyze.py` needs to be modified to accept a `--session` or `--deck` context flag to load `.agent/state/session.yaml` and `.agent/deck/*.yaml` into its prompt context.\n\n3.  **Missing Session Lifecycle**\n    *   **Current State:** `CARD-SES-001` describes creating a session, but no automation runs this.\n    *   **Gap:** The agent boot protocol (`KERNEL.md`) does not require running `deal_cards.py` or initializing a session.\n\n### Recommendation\n**Do not proceed with integration.**\nThe project has pivoted to a \"Worse is Better\" philosophy (see `CUTTING_PLAN.md`). The Decision Deck was correctly identified as over-engineering (\"Spec Theater\").\n*   **Action:** Verify `.agent/state/` is added to `.gitignore` to prevent trash files from being tracked, then leave the deck artifacts in `.agent/deck/` as reference or archive them."
