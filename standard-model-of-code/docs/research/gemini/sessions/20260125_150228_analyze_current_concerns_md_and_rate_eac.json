Hours) | Rationale |\n| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |\n| **CC-001** | Scope Leakage (Node Count) | **90** | **85** | **2.0** | Fixing exclusion lists is isolated logic. Crucial because current metrics are \"untrustworthy.\" |\n| **CC-002** | Reachability Bottleneck | **60** | **100** | **8.0** | **STRATEGIC BLOCKER.** Unblocks Phase 3 & 4. Moderate risk as it changes graph topology reasoning. |\n| **HC-001** | Tree-sitter Dependency | **99** | **80** | **0.5** | Trivial fix (pin version) that resolves 11 failing tests immediately. High ROI. |\n| **HC-002** | 88 Skipped Tests | **90** | **60** | **4.0** | Auditing skips is safe. Value lies in revealing hidden regressions before major refactors. |\n| **HC-003** | BARE System Missing | **90** | **75** | **20.0+** | New feature implementation (safe but slow). Essential for self-refinement loops. |\n| **HC-004** | UPB Unintegrated | **70** | **50** | **6.0** | Visual features only. Moderate complexity to wire backend docs to WebGL frontend. |\n| **HC-005** | Aquarela Theme | **85** | **40** | **5.0** | Mostly CSS/UI work. Low risk, but largely cosmetic compared to logic blockers. |\n| **HC-006** | Sprint-002 DoD | **85** | **70** | **16.0** | High effort required to close out the sprint. Missing tools (Inventory, Boundary) are needed. |\n| **HC-007** | Wave-Particle Asymmetry | **100** | **40** | **8.0** | Documentation task. Zero risk to runtime, improves maintainability. |\n| **HC-008** | analyze.py Monolith | **40** | **70** | **12.0** | Refactoring 3k lines is high risk for regressions. Should wait until tests (HC-001/002) are solid. |\n| **MC-001** | Snapshot Stage Counts | **95** | **30** | **2.0** | Telemetry improvement. Low risk, low immediate strategic impact. |\n| **MC-004** | Stale Wave Tools | **100** | **20** | **0.5** | Moving files to archive. Zero risk, cleans up workspace. |\n| **MC-006** | Centripetal Scan Blocked | **80** | **50** | **4.0** | Blocked by API limits. Requires batching logic implementation. |\n| **MC-007** | Cross-Language (TS/JS) | **85** | **40** | **10.0** | Phase 8 requirement. Independent of current Python focus. |\n| **MC-008** | Circuit Breaker Cleanup | **95** | **10** | **0.5** | Deleting code already hidden by CSS. Safe cleanup. |\n\n---\n\n### Ranked Execution Order (Next 5 Actions)\n\nThis order prioritizes stabilizing the environment (tests), fixing the trustworthiness of data (metrics), and then attacking the primary strategic blocker.\n\n#### 1. HC-001: Fix Tree-sitter Dependency\n*   **Why:** It is an Environment Bug causing 11 tests to fail. We cannot reliably refactor or debug complex issues (like CC-002) if the test suite is red due to dependencies.\n*   **Action:** Pin `tree-sitter>=0.20,<0.22` in `requirements.txt`.\n*   **Effort:** 30 mins.\n\n#### 2. CC-001: Fix Scope Leakage\n*   **Why:** Metric inflation (+138%) means we are analyzing vendor code. This adds noise to the \"Reachability\" debugging (CC-002). We need a clean, accurate graph before trying to trace entry points.\n*   **Action:** Debug `exclusion_list` loading in `full_analysis.py`.\n*   **Effort:** 2 hours.\n\n#### 3. MC-004: Archive Stale Wave Tools\n*   **Why:** \"Quick win\" cleanup. Removes 1,800 lines of noise from the codebase context before beginning heavier logic work.\n*   **Action:** Move identified files to `archive/deprecated_wave_tools/`.\n*   **Effort:** 30 mins.\n\n#### 4. HC-002: Audit Skipped Tests\n*   **Why:** 40% of the suite is skipped. Before attacking the Reachability Bottleneck (CC-002), we need to ensure no existing logic regarding topology or parsing is silently failing.\n*   **Action:** Review `@pytest.mark.skip` decorators; enable critical tests; document permanent skips.\n*   **Effort:** 4 hours.\n\n#### 5. CC-002: Attack Reachability Bottleneck (Phase 3 Blocker)\n*   **Why:** This is the project's **Strategic Blocker**. With the environment fixed, metrics accurate, and tests audited, we can safely implement the complex logic required to trace FastAPI/Typer entry points.\n*   **Action:** Expand entrypoint detection rules in `topology_reasoning.py`.\n*   **Effort:** 8 hours (Initial sprint)."
