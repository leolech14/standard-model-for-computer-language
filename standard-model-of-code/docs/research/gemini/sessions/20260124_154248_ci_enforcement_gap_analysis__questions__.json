      "content": "Okay, I've analyzed the provided codebase context, focusing on the agent kernel, subsystem integration, and relevant specifications, along with the user's query. Here's the analysis and recommendation:\n\n**1. Does this project have GitHub Actions or any CI/CD setup?**\n\nBased on the provided files, there's **no explicit evidence** of a CI/CD setup like GitHub Actions *currently in place*. While \"CI/CD \u2192 Archive\" is mentioned as a proposed integration in `.agent/SUBSYSTEM_INTEGRATION.md`, it's listed under \"Proposed\" integrations, not \"Implemented\".  Also, while there *is* a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file, which implies using `pre-commit`, the tool itself can only enforce hooks locally.\n\n**2. If yes, where are the workflow files?**\n\nSince there's no concrete evidence of CI/CD, there are **no workflow files** mentioned. The example workflow in `.agent/specs/WAVE_PARTICLE_SYMMETRY.md` is hypothetical.\n\n**3. Should pre-commit/commitlint be enforced in CI?**\n\n**Yes, pre-commit/commitlint *should* be enforced in CI.**\n\n**4. What is the recommendation - add CI enforcement or skip it?**\n\n**Recommendation: YES, add CI enforcement.**\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n*   **Non-Negotiable Enforcement:** The `KERNEL.md` file states Conventional Commits are \"Non-Negotiable #2\" and enforced by pre-commit hooks. Currently, this enforcement only exists *locally* for developers who have set up the hooks.  Without CI enforcement, commits that violate the Conventional Commits standard can still be pushed to the repository, defeating the purpose of the standard.\n\n*   **Closing the Enforcement Loop:** `.agent/SUBSYSTEM_INTEGRATION.md` clearly states that \"Commit Hygiene (pre-commit) validates before commit\" and this is \"ACTIVE\". If it is `ACTIVE`, then it must be consistently true. Only automated CI enforcement ensures *consistent* application of these hooks.\n\n*   **Catching Accidental Bypasses:** Developers might accidentally bypass local hooks (e.g., with `git commit --no-verify`). CI enforcement acts as a final safety net.\n\n*   **Consistent Environment:** CI provides a consistent environment for running the hooks, preventing issues caused by different local setups.\n\n*   **Enforcing Post-Commit Hooks:** Project uses *post-commit* hooks, which requires a system to act. CI system can run those hooks.\n\n**Implementation Steps:**\n\n1.  **Create a GitHub Actions Workflow:** Create a `.github/workflows/commitlint.yml` file (or similar) to define a workflow that runs on each push and pull request.\n2.  **Install pre-commit in CI:** Add a step to install `pre-commit` within the CI environment.\n3.  **Run pre-commit:** Add a step to run `pre-commit run --all-files` to check all files in the repository.\n4.  **Configure commitlint:** Ensure the CI environment has access to the `commitlint.config.js` file and any necessary dependencies.  Consider using a dedicated `commitlint` action if available.\n5.  **Fail the build:** Configure the workflow to fail if `pre-commit` or `commitlint` detects any violations.\n6.  **Test Thoroughly:** Make sure the CI configuration works seamlessly and provides meaningful error messages.\n\n**Revised Architecture Diagram:**\n\nIf a CI system were to be integrated, then the Subsystem Integration Map would need to be updated. The new component would need to be added to the Subsystem Registry, the Data Flow would need to be updated to include another input to Collider, and the Integration Points section would need a new section, \"Implemented\".\n"
