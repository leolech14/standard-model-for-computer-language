However, to maximize the potential of AI agent-assisted development, consider a combination of tools like:\n\n1.  **Immediate Staging:** Use `git add -p` (4).\n2.  **Pre-Commit Message Enforcement:** Enforce commit standards with `Pre-commit + Commitlint` (20).\n3.  **Automated commit message generation** Use `OpenCommit` (21).\n\nThis approach gives fine-grained staging control, commit message hygiene, and is simple to configure.\nIf you are willing to invest more in a commercial, AI-native workflow, consider GitHub Copilot Draft PRs alongside Git Worktrees for each agent to enable isolation. Note GitButler shows promise but its pricing model and lack of open-source components makes it less desirable.\nTensorZero isn't suitable given its retrospective analysis.\n```\n\n**Justification for Scores:**\n\n*   `git add -p`: Excellent for dissecting existing changes. Low prevention (requires discipline). Trivial setup. Not AI-native.\n*   GitButler: Useful for long-term management and AI coordination, but cumbersome initial setup. Virtual branches offer useful separation, not entirely open source.\n*   Aider: Strong AI-native design with auto-commits. However, this could lead to loss of control and is hard to use on existing uncommitted files.\n*   CCheckpoints: Designed for saving LLM states; does not solve the immediate staging need.\n*   Git Worktrees: Excellent for parallel development and agent isolation, but not suited to clean up the unorganized working dir immediately.\n*   OpenCommit: Helps with generating commit messages (Good commit hygiene).\n*   Pre-commit + Commitlint: Enforces standard commits.\n*   Git-cliff: Automates changelog from commit which helps automate part of the commit process.\n*   GitHub Copilot Draft PRs: Can help guide coding practice and suggest appropriate commits.\n*   TensorZero: Designed for historical analysis, less useful for the mess at hand.\n\nThis decision matrix should help the team understand the trade-offs between different approaches and make a well-informed decision about which tool(s) best suit their needs.\n"
