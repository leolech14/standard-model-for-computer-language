      "content": "Validate architectural change: Replace cron/time-based daemon triggers (LaunchAgent StartCalendarInterval, ThrottleInterval) with activation-based triggers inspired by neural networks. Concept: events accumulate activation energy, fire when pattern stabilizes (low energy state), composition rules (event A + event B triggers process C). Benefits: eliminates thundering herd, natural coherence, semantic triggers vs clock triggers. Risks? Implementation complexity? Prior art in event-driven architectures?"
