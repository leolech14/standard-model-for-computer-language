      "content": "Here is the scoring analysis of the proposed terminology model based on the active codebase context.\n\n| Dimension | Score | Analysis |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **FACTUAL** | **95/100** | **Accurate Mapping.** The model precisely maps to the repository's physical state. The codebase is strictly divided into executable logic (`src`, `tools`) and semantic definitions (`docs`, `registry`, `schemas`). The \"Domains\" list (Pipeline, Viz, Governance) accurately reflects the active scopes defined in `KERNEL.md` (e.g., `.agent` for governance, `collider` for pipeline). |\n| **ALIGNMENT** | **65/100** | **Metaphor Clash.** The project uses a **Quantum Physics** metaphor (Standard Model, Particle/Wave, Collider, Objects/Concepts). The `-OME` suffix introduces a **Biological Systems** metaphor (Genome, Proteome). While it serves the mission of identifying \"constituents,\" it cuts across the established `Concepts` (Specs) vs `Objects` (Instances) duality defined in the Kernel. |\n| **USEFULNESS** | **92/100** | **High Utility for Context Engineering.** This is superior to the current model for **Token Budgeting**. It allows the agent to instantly classify files: `CODOME` files are typically high-attention targets (Guru tier), while `CONTEXTOME` files are reference materials best suited for RAG or \"Sandwiching\" (Architect/Archeologist tiers). It turns abstract architecture into concrete file-handling rules. |\n\n### Summary Recommendation\n**Adopt as Operational Taxonomy.** While it clashes with the *philosophical* Physics metaphor, it is highly effective as an *operational* model for the AI agent to manage context windows and file priorities.\n\n**Mapping to Current Architecture:**\n*   **Codome** \u2248 Particle (Implementation/Objects)\n*   **Contextome** \u2248 Wave (Specs/Concepts) + Registry Data\n*   **Projectome** \u2248 The Repository Root"
