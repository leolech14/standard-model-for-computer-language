      "content": "TOPOLOGY INTEGRATION AUDIT - We have 3 topology-related specs that need coherence validation:\n\n1. SCALE_INOUT_TOPOLOGY.md - Treats 16 SCALE levels as an INTERNAL/EXTERNAL axis (not vertical hierarchy). External=world knowledge (Perplexity zone), Internal=code context (Gemini zone), Core=pure analysis (Collider zone). RG flow analogy: UV\u2192IR.\n\n2. CODOME_LANDSCAPE.md - The navigable terrain metaphor. Elevation=complexity, Gradients=difficulty slopes, Betti numbers for topological features, Codespace is hyperbolic/fractal/non-Euclidean, has wormholes and caves.\n\n3. CODESPACE_ALGEBRA.md \u00a710.5 - Purpose Field shape as FOCUSING FUNNEL across 16 levels. Diffuse at L0, sharp at L12. Magnitude grows exponentially up, variance decreases exponentially up.\n\nQUESTIONS FOR GEMINI:\n1. Are these three topology models COMPATIBLE or CONTRADICTORY?\n2. Is SCALE_INOUT (internal/external axis) compatible with Purpose Field FUNNEL (bottom/top focusing)?\n3. Does the Landscape terrain metaphor work with both?\n4. What is the UNIFIED topology that integrates all three?\n5. Are there gaps or inconsistencies we should fix?\n\nProvide concrete analysis with specific references to how the models interact."
