The feedback was harsh but constructive. Here are the key findings:\n\n## WHAT WORKS\n1. Boot script (boot.sh) - clean, JSON output, commands detected\n2. Decision Deck - innovative, constrains AI chaos, beautiful terminal UI\n3. Definition of Done (DOD.md) - rigorous, evidence-based\n4. Wave/Particle metaphor - intellectually coherent\n\n## CRITICAL PROBLEMS\n1. SCAVENGER HUNT: 10+ documents to understand how to start (CLAUDE.md \u2192 AGENT_INITIATION.md \u2192 AGENT_KERNEL.md \u2192 INDEX.md \u2192 REPO_FACTS.md \u2192 WORKFLOWS.md \u2192 DOD.md \u2192 AI_USER_GUIDE.md)\n\n2. MULTIPLE COMPETING ENTRY POINTS: CLAUDE.md, AGENT_INITIATION.md, AGENT_KERNEL.md, INDEX.md all claim to be 'start here'\n\n3. COGNITIVE OVERLOAD: Before doing anything, agent must understand Wave/Particle, Brain/Body, Decision Deck, Meters, 4D Confidence, Phase gating, Three AI roles, Research schemas, HSL, BARE, AEP, REFINERY, CENTRIPETAL\n\n4. NO PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE: Everything at maximum complexity, no Quick Start, no levels\n\n## PROPOSED SOLUTIONS\n1. CONCIERGE MODEL: Single boot command with rich, context-aware output that knows who you are\n2. PROGRESSIVE DOCS: QUICK_START.md (20 lines) \u2192 COOKBOOK.md \u2192 deep/ folder\n3. ELIMINATE CASCADE: No more 'read this first which says read this first'\n4. CONTEXT-AWARE GREETING: Use existing intelligence (meters, task history) at first contact\n\nQUESTIONS FOR ANALYSIS:\n1. Do you agree with this assessment? What am I missing?\n2. What is the minimum viable onboarding that preserves rigor?\n3. How do we balance 'made specially for you' premium feel with the genuine complexity of this system?\n4. What specific files should be consolidated/killed/created?\n5. Is there academic research on AI agent onboarding that validates or contradicts these recommendations?"
