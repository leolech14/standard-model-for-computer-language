Is INFRASTRUCTURE a third category?\n   - Module (does work)\n   - Automation (triggers work)\n   - Infrastructure (enables work?)\n\n2. Or is INFRASTRUCTURE orthogonal?\n   - Infrastructure is WHERE things run\n   - Automation is WHEN things run\n   - Module is WHAT runs\n\n3. Or is there a hierarchy?\n   - Infrastructure contains Automation contains Modules?\n   - Or: Modules run ON Infrastructure, triggered BY Automation?\n\nCONCRETE EXAMPLES in PROJECT_elements:\n\n| Thing | Module? | Automation? | Infrastructure? |\n|-------|---------|-------------|-----------------|\n| analyze.py | Yes (does AI analysis) | No | No |\n| autopilot.py | No | Yes (triggers others) | No? Or Yes? |\n| GCS bucket | No | No | Yes |\n| Cloud Run job | No | Yes? | Yes? |\n| LaunchAgent plist | No | Yes | No? Or Infra? |\n| Docker container | No | No | Yes |\n| Post-commit hook | No | Yes | Infra? |\n\nTHE CONFUSION:\n- Is a 'Cloud Run job' automation or infrastructure?\n- Is the 'trigger mechanism' (cron, webhook) automation or infrastructure?\n- When does 'automation code' become 'infrastructure'?\n\nPOSSIBLE DISTINCTIONS:\nA. Infrastructure = the RUNTIME SUBSTRATE (VMs, containers, networks)\nB. Infrastructure = SHARED SERVICES (databases, queues, storage)\nC. Infrastructure = anything that OUTLIVES a single execution\nD. Infrastructure = the PLATFORM that automation runs ON\n\nWhat is the proper relationship between these concepts?\nIs there a clean ontological boundary or do they blur?"

      "content": "Based on the codebase analysis\u2014specifically the **Standard Model of Code** (`MODEL.md`), **Codespace Algebra** (`CODESPACE_ALGEBRA.md`), and the **Architecture Maps**\u2014here is the ontological resolution.\n\n### The Verdict: Infrastructure is the SUBSTRATE (The \"Where\")\n\nYour intuition #2 is the most mathematically consistent with the Standard Model: **Infrastructure is orthogonal.**\n\nIt completes the **Tripartite Causality Chain** of software:\n\n1.  **MODULE (Capability)**: *Potential Energy*. Code that knows **HOW** to do something.\n    *   *Nature:* 1st Order.\n    *   *Question:* **WHAT** runs?\n    *   *Example:* `analyze.py` (knows how to query Gemini).\n\n2.  **AUTOMATION (Policy)**: *Kinetic Energy*. Code that decides **WHEN** to release potential.\n    *   *Nature:* 2nd Order (Meta-code).\n    *   *Question:* **WHEN** does it run?\n    *   *Example:* `drift_guard.py` (decides to run analysis when files change).\n\n3.  **INFRASTRUCTURE (Substrate)**: *Space/Time*. The environment **WHERE** the event occurs.\n    *   *Nature:* 0 Order (The Ground).\n    *   *Question:* **WHERE** does it exist?\n    *   *Example:* Docker Container, Cloud Run, File System, OS Scheduler (launchd).\n\n---\n\n### The Classification Matrix\n\nApplying this ontology to your concrete examples resolves the ambiguities:\n\n| Thing | Category | Reasoning |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| `analyze.py` | **MODULE** | It is pure logic/capability. It does nothing until called. |\n| `autopilot.py` | **AUTOMATION** | It is policy. It encodes the *decision* to execute modules. |\n| GCS bucket | **INFRASTRUCTURE** | It is a passive storage substrate. |\n| Cloud Run *Service* | **INFRASTRUCTURE** | It is the container host (The \"Where\"). |\n| Cloud Run *Job Definition* | **AUTOMATION** | The configuration that says \"Run X on schedule Y\" is Policy. |\n| LaunchAgent `.plist` | **AUTOMATION** (Config) | It acts as the *binding* between Substrate (OS) and Module. |\n| Docker container | **INFRASTRUCTURE** | It is the runtime boundary/environment. |\n| Post-commit hook | **AUTOMATION** | It is a trigger mechanism (Policy: \"After commit, do X\"). |\n\n### The Ontological Boundaries\n\n#### 1. The Boundary between Automation and Infrastructure\n**Confusion:** \"Is `cron` automation or infrastructure?\"\n\n**Resolution:**\n*   **The Cron Daemon (Service):** Infrastructure. It provides the *capability* to schedule time.\n*   **The Crontab Entry (Config):** Automation. It creates the specific *policy* to act at 5:00 PM.\n\n> **Rule:** If it provides a capability to *host* or *store*, it is Infrastructure. If it provides a specific instruction to *act*, it is Automation.\n\n#### 2. The Boundary between Module and Automation\n**Confusion:** \"Is `autopilot.py` a module because it contains code?\"\n\n**Resolution:**\n*   **Module:** Operates on *Data* (Input $\\to$ Output).\n*   **Automation:** Operates on *Modules* (State $\\to$ Execution).\n\n> **Rule:** If the code imports business logic to execute it based on a trigger, it is Automation. If the code implements the business logic itself, it is a Module.\n\n### The Unified Theory (Physics Metaphor)\n\nUsing the `PROJECT_elements` physics metaphor:\n\n1.  **INFRASTRUCTURE is the Vacuum/Metric.**\n    It is the spacetime grid. It has \"capacity\" (CPU, RAM, Storage) but no intent.\n    *   *Google Cloud, Local Filesystem, Docker.*\n\n2.  **MODULES are the Particles.**\n    They have mass (code size) and charge (purpose). They exist within the Infrastructure.\n    *   *Collider, ACI, BARE.*\n\n3.  **AUTOMATION is the Force Carrier (Boson).**\n    It mediates interactions between particles. It causes the \"collapse\" of potential code into running process.\n    *   *Cron, Hooks, Watchers, Daemons.*\n\n### Practical Application for `PROJECT_elements`\n\nWhen classifying code in the **Contextome**:\n\n1.  **Code that DOES analysis** $\\to$ **Codome / Domain: Pipeline** (`src/core/`)\n2.  **Code that WATCHES files to run analysis** $\\to$ **Codome / Domain: Governance** (`.agent/tools/drift_guard.py`)\n3.  **Configuration that DEFINES the container** $\\to$ **Contextome / Domain: Infrastructure** (`Dockerfile`, `deployment.yaml`)\n\n**The Litmus Test:**\nIf you delete the **Module**, the capability is lost.\nIf you delete the **Automation**, the capability exists but no one presses the button.\nIf you delete the **Infrastructure**, the code has nowhere to exist."
