      "content": "Based on the codebase context provided (specifically `full_analysis.py` which references several of these files) and the file names, here is the categorization of the 20 orphan files and the recommendation for the `CODOME_MANIFEST.yaml`.\n\n### 1. Categorization by Purpose\n\nI have grouped the files into four distinct domains based on the \"Standard Model of Code\" architecture observed in the context.\n\n#### Group A: Core Graph Engine (The Physics)\nThese files provide the fundamental logic for the analysis pipeline seen in `full_analysis.py`. They appear as orphans likely because they are **library definitions** or **helpers** imported by the main pipeline but not calling out to much else themselves, or they are utilities.\n*   `graph_framework.py`: **Critical.** Defines how the graph is built (`build_nx_graph`, `find_entry_points`).\n*   `graph_metrics.py`: **Critical.** Calculates centrality and critical nodes.\n*   `intent_extractor.py`: **Critical.** Extracts docstrings and commit signals.\n*   `identity_matcher.py`: Logic for resolving node identity (likely used during graph construction).\n*   `visibility_analyzer.py`: logic for determining scope/visibility (public/private).\n\n#### Group B: UI & Visualization (The Lens)\nThese files represent the presentation layer. UI entry points often appear as orphans because nothing calls *them*; they call the backend.\n*   `industrial_ui.py`: Likely the main entry point or container for the UI.\n*   `chart_viewer.py`: Component for rendering visualizations.\n*   `scientific_charts.py`: Library for generating the specific chart types.\n*   `UI_CONTROLS_SCHEMA.md`: **Schema.** Defines the contract for UI interactions.\n*   `UI_REFACTOR_IMPLEMENTATION_LOGIC.md`: *Process Artifact (Temporary).*\n*   `UI_ARCHITECTURE_VALIDATION_CONSOLIDATED.md`: *Process Artifact (Temporary).*\n*   `UI_OVERHAUL_CONTEXT_INVENTORY.md`: *Process Artifact (Temporary).*\n\n#### Group C: Theoretical Definitions (The Theory)\nThese define the \"Codome\" theory (Standard Model). These are crucial for the `CODOME_MANIFEST` as they define the mental model.\n*   `SCALE_INOUT_TOPOLOGY.md`: Defines the topological structure (Scale-Free/In-Out).\n*   `HEALTH_MODEL_CONSOLIDATED.md`: Defines what constitutes \"healthy\" code in this system.\n*   `PROPERTY_QUERY_DATA_FLOW.md`: Documentation on how data flows through the system.\n*   `research_schemas.yaml`: **Schema.** Data definitions for the research/analysis layer.\n*   `SEMANTIC_INDEXER_IMPLEMENTATION.md`: Documentation on how the semantic engine works.\n\n#### Group D: Specialized Analysis (The Tools)\nSpecific analysis tools that likely plug into the main pipeline.\n*   `wave_extractor.py`: Likely a specialized extractor (perhaps for \"waves\" of execution or phased analysis).\n*   `symmetry_reporter.py`: Reporting tool for structural symmetry.\n*   `laboratory_bridge.py`: Integration layer (Bridge pattern) likely connecting the core analysis to an experimental \"laboratory\" environment.\n\n---\n\n### 2. CODOME_MANIFEST.yaml Recommendations\n\nThe `CODOME_MANIFEST.yaml` should define the **boundary**, **schema**, and **entry points** of the system. Process logs (like refactor plans) should be excluded.\n\n**\u2705 MUST ADD (Structural Definitions & Core Logic)**\n*   **`research_schemas.yaml`**: Essential. Defines the data structure.\n*   **`graph_framework.py`**: Essential. Defines the graph topology rules.\n*   **`graph_metrics.py`**: Essential. Defines the measurement rules.\n*   **`intent_extractor.py`**: Essential. Defines how meaning is derived.\n*   **`UI_CONTROLS_SCHEMA.md`**: Essential. Defines the UI interface contract.\n*   **`SCALE_INOUT_TOPOLOGY.md`**: Essential. Theoretical basis for the graph structure.\n*   **`HEALTH_MODEL_CONSOLIDATED.md`**: Essential. Theoretical basis for metrics.\n\n**\u26a0\ufe0f CONSIDER ADDING (Entry Points & Bridges)**\n*   **`industrial_ui.py`**: Add if this is the canonical UI entry point.\n*   **`laboratory_bridge.py`**: Add if this defines the interface to external systems/experiments.\n\n**\u274c DO NOT ADD (Process Artifacts)**\n*   `UI_REFACTOR_IMPLEMENTATION_LOGIC.md`\n*   `UI_ARCHITECTURE_VALIDATION_CONSOLIDATED.md`\n*   `UI_OVERHAUL_CONTEXT_INVENTORY.md`\n*   *(These are temporal logs, not system definitions).*\n\n### 3. YAML Snippet for Update\n\nHere is how you should structure the addition to your `CODOME_MANIFEST.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nmanifest:\n  definitions:\n    schemas:\n      - path: \"research_schemas.yaml\"\n        type: \"data_contract\"\n        description: \"Core data structures for research analysis\"\n      - path: \"UI_CONTROLS_SCHEMA.md\"\n        type: \"interface_contract\"\n        description: \"Schema definition for UI control surfaces\"\n    \n    theory:\n      - path: \"SCALE_INOUT_TOPOLOGY.md\"\n        type: \"architecture_definition\"\n      - path: \"HEALTH_MODEL_CONSOLIDATED.md\"\n        type: \"metrics_definition\"\n\n  components:\n    core_engine:\n      - path: \"graph_framework.py\"\n        role: \"topology_builder\"\n      - path: \"graph_metrics.py\"\n        role: \"analytics_engine\"\n      - path: \"intent_extractor.py\"\n        role: \"semantic_processor\"\n    \n    presentation:\n      - path: \"industrial_ui.py\"\n        role: \"ui_entry_point\"\n```"
