Concierge single entry point - excellent UX\n2. Rules front-loaded - primacy effect applied\n3. DOD bulletproof - clear checklist\n\n## NEW PROBLEMS FOUND\n1. AGENT_KERNEL.md still references old boot.sh, not ./concierge (conflicting instructions)\n2. Inbox is black box - 34 items, no preview, no priority signal\n3. No 'why should I care' section - value not immediately visible\n4. Tutorial too short (5 steps, 6 lines) vs elaborate theory docs\n5. Physics metaphors (Wave/Particle/Observer) obscure navigation - academically interesting but operationally confusing\n6. Glossary 340 lines - too many concepts before first action\n\n## PROPOSED QUICK WINS\n1. Update AGENT_KERNEL.md to point to ./concierge\n2. Add top 3 inbox items to concierge output\n3. Add 'Why this system' value proposition to concierge\n\nQUESTIONS:\n1. Are these the right priorities?\n2. Should we remove physics metaphors from navigation docs entirely?\n3. What's the minimum viable glossary for day-1 agent?\n4. How do we balance 'academically rigorous' with 'operationally useful'?"
