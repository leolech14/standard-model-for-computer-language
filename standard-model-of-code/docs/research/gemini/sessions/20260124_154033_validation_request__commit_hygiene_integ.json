      "content": "Based on the provided codebase context, here is the validation analysis for the **Commit Hygiene** integration.\n\n### 1. Analysis of Requirements\n\n1.  **Is commit hygiene documented in KERNEL.md Non-Negotiables?**\n    *   **YES.**\n    *   **Evidence:** Section `Non-Negotiables` item #2 explicitly states: *\"Conventional Commits - All commits must follow format...\"*.\n    *   **Evidence:** It also includes a dedicated subsection `Commit Format (Enforced by pre-commit hooks)` and lists the config files under `Key Paths`.\n\n2.  **Is it registered in SUBSYSTEM_INTEGRATION.md as a subsystem?**\n    *   **YES.**\n    *   **Evidence:** Listed in `Subsystem Registry` as **S8 (Commit Hygiene)**.\n    *   **Evidence:** Included in `Data Flow` (Git commit \u2190 Commit Hygiene).\n    *   **Evidence:** Documented in `Cross-Reference Index` with setup instructions.\n\n3.  **Is the setup command in CLAUDE.md Commands table?**\n    *   **UNVERIFIED (Context Missing).**\n    *   **Note:** The file `CLAUDE.md` was not provided in the context. However, the command `pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg --hook-type pre-commit` **IS** present in `KERNEL.md` under the `Quick Commands` table. Since `KERNEL.md` is the bootstrap file, this is sufficient for agent discovery, but `CLAUDE.md` should be checked manually to ensure consistency.\n\n4.  **Are there any GAPS or missing integration points?**\n    *   **Manifest Gap:** `manifest.yaml` contains a `validation` section (lines 78-82) defining patterns for Tasks and Runs. It does **not** explicitly define the `commit_message_pattern` or reference `commitlint.config.js`. While not strictly necessary (as the hook enforces it), adding it here would align with the \"Machine-Readable Discovery\" goal of the manifest.\n\n5.  **Will a new agent FIND this when onboarding?**\n    *   **YES.**\n    *   **Reasoning:** The `Boot Protocol` in `KERNEL.md` (Step 1) requires reading `KERNEL.md`. The Non-Negotiables section is prominent, and the `Quick Commands` section provides the installation command immediately.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Integration Rating\n\n**Completeness: 95%**\n\nThe integration is architecturally sound and well-documented in the core kernel and subsystem maps. The only deductions are for the unverified `CLAUDE.md` and a minor enhancement opportunity in the Manifest.\n\n### 3. Missing Pieces / Recommendations\n\nTo reach 100% completeness:\n\n1.  **Verify CLAUDE.md**: Ensure the `pre-commit install` command is duplicated in `CLAUDE.md` for agents that look there for \"cheat sheet\" commands.\n2.  **Update Manifest (Optional)**: Add the commit validation config to `manifest.yaml` for consistency:\n    ```yaml\n    # .agent/manifest.yaml\n    validation:\n      ...\n      commit_config: commitlint.config.js\n    ```\n3.  **CI Integration**: `SUBSYSTEM_INTEGRATION.md` mentions \"Git commit \u2190 Commit Hygiene\" as **ACTIVE** (local), but does not explicitly detail if this is also enforced in CI (GitHub Actions). If CI enforcement exists, it should be listed in the Integration Points table."
