I have initialized the **PROJECT_elements** context.\n\nI am ready to operate within the **Standard Model of Code** architecture:\n\n*   **Particle Realm** (`standard-model-of-code/`): The Collider engine, 94 atoms, and measurement tools.\n*   **Wave Realm** (`context-management/`): The ACI (Adaptive Context Intelligence), theory, and documentation.\n*   **Observer Realm** (`.agent/`): The Task Registry, BARE engine, and governance protocols.\n\nThe system appears to be in **Phase 2: Intelligence**, with the \"Sprint-001\" executing.\n\nAwaiting your command. You can ask me to:\n1.  **Analyze** a part of the Codome (`./collider full ...`).\n2.  **Query** the Contextome (ACI).\n3.  **Claim** a task from the Registry.\n4.  **Verify** symmetry between code and docs (HSL)."
