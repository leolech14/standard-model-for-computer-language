      "content": "We're building an integration spine for PROJECT_elements where every new AI agent inherits a palace of automated butlers that maintain: (1) consolidated knowledge chunks via Refinery, (2) system health metrics via Communication Fabric, (3) certified action templates via Decision Deck, (4) ultra-fast local LLM assistance via Ollama for surgical context provision. \n\nThe goal: New agent opens terminal, concierge shows complete system state in <1 second by querying all butlers, agent picks action, gets surgically relevant context (not entire files), Ollama provides <100ms suggestions.\n\nCurrent state: 20 butlers exist separately. Need to design the integration protocol where each butler exposes a standard interface, concierge queries all in parallel, provides unified context.\n\nCritical requirement: Everything must stay automatic and never degrade from recursive processing (knowledge \u2192 docs \u2192 knowledge loop). Need validation gates, incremental processing, convergence detection.\n\nDiscuss the architectural approach for this butler integration protocol. What's the right abstraction? How do we ensure robustness? What are the failure modes?"
