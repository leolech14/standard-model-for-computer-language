      "content": "TERMINOLOGY CRISIS: We have three overlapping concepts in our project glossary that are causing confusion:\n\n1. REALM (Particle/Wave/Observer) - Directory-based partition. Files belong to exactly ONE realm based on path. Clear, working.\n\n2. DOMAIN - Defined as 'vertical slice through code and docs' with semantic purpose. Math says domains COVER (can overlap). But:\n   - All current domains are realm-local (no overlap exists)\n   - Theory domain has NO code (violates 'every domain has code AND docs')\n   - Term is marked DEPRECATED in one file but still used in glossary\n   - Used colloquially in OPEN_CONCERNS.md to mean 'area of concern'\n\n3. CONCORDANCE - New replacement term emphasizing PURPOSE ALIGNMENT between code and docs, with a measurable score.\n\nThe question: Should we:\nA) Kill 'Domain' entirely, keep Realm (physical) + Concordance (semantic with measurement)\nB) Redefine 'Domain' simply as 'area of concern' (accept colloquial usage, drop formal math)\nC) Fix the formal definition to match actual usage (realm-local slices only)\n\nConsider: clarity for AI agents, human developers, theoretical consistency, practical utility. What's the best path forward?"
