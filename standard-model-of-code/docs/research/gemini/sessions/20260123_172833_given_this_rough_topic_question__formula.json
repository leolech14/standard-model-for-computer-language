INTERNAL scales (Bit\u2192Function) are code-proximal and self-contained. EXTERNAL scales (Project\u2192Universe) are world-distal and context-dependent. The boundary at Project/Workspace is where code meets world. This parallels RG flow in physics (UV\u2192IR) and information theory (H(X) internal, H(Y|X) external).\n\nProvide ONLY the research question, no explanation."
