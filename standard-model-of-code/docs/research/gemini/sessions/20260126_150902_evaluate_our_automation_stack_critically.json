AUTOPILOT (post-commit hook):\n   - Runs TDJ (file indexer) - 5456 files indexed\n   - Runs trigger_engine for macros\n   - Logs everything to jsonl\n   \n2. HSL-DAEMON (LaunchAgent):\n   - Watches files for changes\n   - Stores file hashes\n   - 643 runs, 4 'violations' found but unclear what happened with them\n\n3. SOCRATIC-AUDIT (LaunchAgent):\n   - Validates code against declared concepts\n   - Produces 54-line reports\n   \n4. MACRO-001 Skeptical Audit:\n   - Triggered on feat(*) commits\n   - 6 steps but some need AI agents\n\nQUESTION: Are these automations actually valuable? Do they align with the Standard Model of Code goals? Should we keep them, simplify them, or kill them? Be brutally honest."
