      "content": "I need to redesign the Collider visualization to unify the ATOMS view and FILES view into ONE graph with animated transitions instead of two separate diagrams.\n\nCURRENT STATE:\n- ATOMS mode: Shows 3200+ atomic nodes (functions, classes, variables) with edges (calls, imports, contains)\n- FILES mode: Shows file/folder structure as separate graph\n- Toggle button switches between them (hard cut, no animation)\n\nDESIRED STATE:\n- ONE unified graph where FILE nodes are containers that CONTAIN atom nodes\n- Files are connected to all atoms inside them (containment edges already exist)\n- Atom nodes and edges can FADE OUT leaving only the file system view\n- File system view shows files connected to folders\n- Smooth animated transition between modes\n- Can also show BOTH layers simultaneously (overlay mode)\n\nQuestions:\n1. What is the current file-viz.js implementation? How does it switch modes?\n2. What edges already exist for file containment?\n3. What animation/transition infrastructure exists (ANIM module)?\n4. What is the best approach for a unified graph with animated opacity transitions?\n5. How should the force layout handle the dual-layer (atoms inside files)?\n\nLook at: modules/file-viz.js, modules/animation.js, modules/visibility.js, data-manager.js, the file_boundaries data structure, and how GRAPH_MODE works in app.js"
