      "content": "No.\n\nThe directory structure should **NOT** physically mirror the CODOME/CONTEXTOME conceptual separation at the top level.\n\nHere are 3 key reasons:\n\n1.  **Reinforces the Realm Architecture (Physics Metaphor):** The project's fundamental organizing principle is the \"Three Realms\" (Particle, Wave, Observer), each corresponding to a top-level directory (`standard-model-of-code/`, `context-management/`, `.agent/`) and a distinct physics role. Each Realm is designed to contain *both* the executable code (Codome) and its directly related documentation and configuration (Contextome) that are cohesive to that Realm's purpose. For example, `standard-model-of-code/` (Particle Realm) contains the Collider's code and its foundational `MODEL.md` theory. Imposing a top-level Codome/Contextome split would dismantle this deliberate and deeply ingrained architectural metaphor.\n\n2.  **Maintains Domain Cohesion:** The project explicitly defines \"Domains\" (e.g., Pipeline, Visualization, AI Tools) as \"vertical slices through both universes\" (`DOMAINS.md`), meaning each domain inherently comprises both code (`D.code` \u2282 Codome) and its associated documentation/configuration (`D.context` \u2282 Contextome). The current structure allows the Codome and Contextome components of a given domain to remain logically grouped within their respective Realms, which simplifies navigation and reasoning about a complete functional area. A top-level Codome/Contextome separation would scatter these related files across disparate root directories, making it harder to understand a domain holistically.\n\n3.  **Optimized for AI Context Management:** The Adaptive Context Intelligence (ACI) system, as configured in `aci_config.yaml` and `analysis_sets.yaml`, is designed to dynamically assemble context for AI agents by using \"analysis sets.\" These sets logically group relevant files (e.g., `pipeline` includes `src/core/full_analysis.py` and `standard-model-of-code/docs/COLLIDER.md`) based on query intent, regardless of whether they are code or documentation. This flexible, semantic grouping is more effective for providing targeted, coherent context to LLMs than a rigid, top-level physical partition based solely on executability, which could isolate functionally related information."
