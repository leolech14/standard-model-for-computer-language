      "content": "Based on the project context and architecture provided in `KERNEL.md` and `SUBSYSTEM_INTEGRATION.md`, here is the pragmatic decision.\n\n### Decision: NO (It is Overkill)\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Shift Left Principle:** You have already implemented **Subsystem S8 (Commit Hygiene)** via local `pre-commit` hooks. This is the optimal place for a solo developer to catch formatting errors. It prevents the \"bad\" commit from ever being created, providing immediate feedback. CI enforcement is reactive (checking *after* the push), forcing you to rewrite history (amend/force-push) to fix typos, which adds unnecessary friction.\n\n2.  **Source of Truth:** As defined in `KERNEL.md`, \"Git is truth.\" Since you and your AI agents are the only writers, and you share the same local environment configuration (bootstrapped via `pre-commit install`), the local gatekeeper is sufficient. There are no untrusted external contributors submitting PRs that bypass your local hooks.\n\n3.  **Maintenance ROI:** Managing a GitHub Actions workflow purely for `commitlint` adds configuration overhead (YAML files, token permissions, node setup) with zero additional value over the local hook. Your \"Non-Negotiables\" are already enforced by the file system constraints you established in Version 1.5.0 of the Kernel.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nTrust the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` setup currently listed in `SUBSYSTEM_INTEGRATION.md`. Only enable CI for tasks that are too slow to run locally (like full regression testing suites), not for syntax/formatting checks."
