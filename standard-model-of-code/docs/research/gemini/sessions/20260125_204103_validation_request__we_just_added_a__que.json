Is this REDUNDANT with existing patterns in the codebase? (check research_schemas.yaml, aci_config.yaml, etc.)\n2. Does it ALIGN with our terminology (Codome/Contextome, Wave/Particle)?\n3. What is MISSING that should be there?\n4. Is this FLUFFY or does it add real value?\n5. How should it INTEGRATE with existing tools (analyze.py, ACI)?\n\nBe critical. Cite specific files if there are conflicts or redundancies."
