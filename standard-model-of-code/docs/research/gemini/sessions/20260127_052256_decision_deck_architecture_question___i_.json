      "content": "The Decision Deck is designed for \"AI Governance\" and \"commit hygiene,\" providing \"certified moves\" to guide both human and AI agents and prevent improvisation. It acts as a canonical set of workflows for repeatable, well-understood operations.\n\nLet's evaluate your questions in light of the project's architecture:\n\n1.  **Would a 'Config Cleanup' card be used more than once?**\n    While your current task of deduplicating MCP server configs is described as a \"one-time cleanup\" for *that specific set of files*, the broader category of \"System Configuration Cleanup\" is highly likely to be needed again. Codebases evolve, tools change, and configuration drift is a common form of technical debt.\n    *   The `DEEP_GHOSTS_REPORT.md` already highlights potential \"Config File Contradictions\" and \"Schema Duplication\" (even if not critical in that audit), indicating that config hygiene is an ongoing concern.\n    *   The project has various `.yaml` and `.json` config files (`context-management/config/`, atom definitions, schemas, `pre-commit-config.yaml`). As `BARE` evolves and new systems are integrated, more config files will appear, and older ones will become stale or redundant.\n    *   **Verdict:** Yes, a general \"System Configuration Cleanup\" card would likely be used more than once for different configuration types or throughout the project's lifecycle.\n\n2.  **Is config deduplication general enough to warrant certification?**\n    \"Config deduplication\" as a *specific task* might seem too granular, but the underlying *process* of identifying redundant or deprecated configuration entries, determining a canonical source, and applying systematic cleanup is highly generalizable. It's a fundamental aspect of maintaining a clean, predictable, and robust system. Given the project's emphasis on structure (\"Standard Model of Code\"), defined schemas, and \"truth validation\" (`BARE/TruthValidator`), ensuring configuration consistency aligns perfectly with its core values.\n    *   **Verdict:** The *process* of configuration cleanup and deduplication is general enough to warrant a certified workflow, even if the specific files change.\n\n3.  **Does adding too many specific cards dilute the Deck's value?**\n    Absolutely. The Decision Deck is meant to be a high-leverage guide, not an exhaustive checklist of every possible action. If every specific cleanup task (e.g., \"clean up `node_modules`\", \"deduplicate `requirements.txt`\", \"clean old logs\") gets its own card, the Deck would become unwieldy, making it harder for agents to find the appropriate \"certified move.\" The goal is to provide guidance for *categories* of actions, allowing for context-specific parameters or sub-tasks within that card's workflow.\n    *   **Verdict:** A card *specifically* for \"MCP server config deduplication\" would be too granular and dilute the Deck's value.\n\n4.  **What's the right granularity for certified moves vs wildcard actions?**\n    *   **Wildcard (`CARD-WLD-000`):** Should be reserved for truly novel, highly unique, or highly context-dependent actions that don't fit into any established, repeatable workflow. It implies a higher degree of improvisation and agent discretion, which the Decision Deck aims to minimize for common operations.\n    *   **Certified Move:** Should represent a repeatable workflow that addresses a common problem or achieves a specific, valuable outcome, providing clear preconditions, steps, expected results, and rollback procedures. It abstracts the \"how\" into a standardized process.\n\n    Your current task of \"deduplicating MCP server configs\" falls into a middle ground. It's not so unique that it *must* be a wildcard, nor is it so common and specific that it needs its own dedicated card. Instead, it suggests the need for a **higher-level, more generalized \"System Configuration Cleanup\" card.** This card would encapsulate the *process* of auditing, canonicalizing, and cleaning up various types of configuration files. Your specific task would then be an *instance* of executing this general card, with the MCP configs as the target scope.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nYou should **create a reusable card for 'System Configuration Cleanup,' but at a higher level of abstraction than just 'config deduplication' or 'MCP server config cleanup.'**\n\nThis new card, perhaps named `CARD-SYS-0XX: System Configuration Audit & Cleanup` (or under an existing `Infrastructure` category), would define a general workflow for identifying and rectifying issues across various configuration files.\n\n**Proposed Card Scope:**\n\n*   **Card ID:** `CARD-SYS-0XX` (e.g., `CARD-SYS-001`)\n*   **Name:** System Configuration Audit & Cleanup\n*   **Category:** System Hygiene / Infrastructure\n*   **Purpose:** To systematically identify, audit, and rectify inconsistencies, redundancies, deprecations, or misconfigurations within the project's various configuration files, ensuring system stability, predictability, and adherence to defined standards.\n*   **Preconditions:**\n    *   Specific configuration files or directories targeted for audit are identified (e.g., `mcp.json`, `context-management/config/`, `standard-model-of-code/src/patterns/`).\n    *   Canonical sources or desired states for the targeted configurations are established (e.g., in related schema files or `MODEL.md`).\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  **Define Scope:** Clearly specify the set of config files/areas to be audited.\n    2.  **Scan for Issues:** Use appropriate tools (e.g., `grep`, `diff`, custom scripts, schema validators) to detect duplicates, deprecated entries, inconsistencies, or deviations from canonical sources.\n    3.  **Analyze & Plan:** Review findings, propose a plan for cleanup (e.g., deduplication strategy, removal of deprecated entries, consolidation), and identify the canonical source(s) for each conflict.\n    4.  **Implement Changes:** Apply modifications to the configuration files according to the approved plan.\n    5.  **Validate:** Run relevant tests, `pre-commit` hooks, and `HSL` checks (if applicable) to ensure no regressions or new issues are introduced.\n    6.  **Document:** Update any related documentation (`ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md`, `AGENTKNOWLEDGEDUMP.md`, or specific component READMEs) if canonical patterns or locations have changed.\n*   **Expected Outcome:** Configuration files are clean, consistent, aligned with project standards, and free of redundancies or deprecated entries. Reduced technical debt.\n*   **Rollback Procedures:** Standard Git revert for all changes made within this card's execution.\n\nBy doing this, your current task of deduplicating MCP server configs becomes a concrete *application* of this general `CARD-SYS-0XX`, making the Deck more useful without unnecessary bloat."
