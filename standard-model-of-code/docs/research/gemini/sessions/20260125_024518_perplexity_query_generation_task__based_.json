DTE (Data Trade Exchange) - exchange/broker patterns in visualization\n2. Semantic Pixel Sovereignty - design systems that achieve 100% token control\n3. OKLCH color space - academic validation for data visualization use\n4. UPB (Universal Property Binder) - declarative visual binding patterns\n5. Provider chain resolution - priority-based fallback patterns\n\nFORMAT EACH QUERY AS:\n---\nQUERY: [The exact search query]\nPURPOSE: [What this validates in our architecture]\nEXPECTED_SOURCES: [Academic, Industry, Standards body]\n---\n\nMake queries specific enough to find authoritative sources, not generic tutorials."

      "content": "Here are the specific research queries designed to validate the architectural foundations of the Collider engine, specifically focusing on the visualization and data management layers defined in `DATA_LAYER_REFACTORING_MAP.md` and the token system in `visualize_graph_webgl.py`.\n\n---\nQUERY: \"architectural patterns for decoupling data ingestion from rendering in large-scale WebGL graph visualization using a central broker or exchange\"\nPURPOSE: [Validates DTE (Data Trade Exchange)] This validates our move from scattered `FULL_GRAPH` global variable access to a centralized `DataManager` class. We need confirmation that an \"Exchange\" pattern is the industry standard for managing state in high-performance visualization, specifically decoupling the \"Physical\" data plane from the \"Virtual\" rendering plane.\nEXPECTED_SOURCES: [IEEE Visualization proceedings, Uber/Netflix engineering blogs, WebGL framework architecture papers]\n---\nQUERY: \"implementation strategies for 'semantic design tokens' in data visualization engines to achieve 100% separation of style and logic\"\nPURPOSE: [Validates Semantic Pixel Sovereignty] This investigates the \"Pixel Sovereignty\" concept where `appearance.tokens.json` dictates all visuals. We are looking for validation of architectures where the rendering engine is purely functional and strictly adheres to a semantic definition file, preventing \"hardcoded magic numbers\" in the visualization code.\nEXPECTED_SOURCES: [Design Systems research (Adobe/Salesforce), CSS architecture papers, W3C Design Tokens Community Group]\n---\nQUERY: \"comparative analysis of OKLCH vs HSL for categorical data visualization emphasizing perceptual uniformity and accessibility\"\nPURPOSE: [Validates OKLCH Usage] Our architecture relies on distinguishing Atoms, Rings, and Tiers via color. We need authoritative confirmation that OKLCH provides superior perceptual uniformity (distinctness of categories without varying perceived brightness) compared to HSL, validating its use in our `AppearanceEngine`.\nEXPECTED_SOURCES: [Color Science academic journals, Data Visualization Society, CSS Color Module Level 4 specifications]\n---\nQUERY: \"declarative visual grammar architectures for binding abstract data properties to visual channels in interactive node-link diagrams\"\nPURPOSE: [Validates UPB (Universal Property Binder)] This explores the theoretical basis for our `TokenResolver` and `Constraint Engine`. We are validating the pattern of using a declarative schema (like `controls.tokens.json`) to bind an abstract property (e.g., \"Stateless Atom\") to a visual output (e.g., \"Opacity 0.8\") without imperative logic.\nEXPECTED_SOURCES: [Grammar of Graphics (Wilkinson), Vega-Lite architectural papers, InfoVis conference papers]\n---\nQUERY: \"algorithms for cascading configuration resolution with multi-layer priority (defaults, user overrides, context-specific) in software architecture\"\nPURPOSE: [Validates Provider Chain Resolution] This validates the logic within `TokenResolver` that determines the final value of a visual property. We are confirming that a \"Provider Chain\" (looking up User -> Theme -> Default) is the robust standard for handling the complexity of the 8-Dimensional semantic space.\nEXPECTED_SOURCES: [Software Architecture patterns, Enterprise configuration management standards, Microsoft/AWS SDK design docs]\n---\nQUERY: \"architectural approaches for handling 'lost in the middle' phenomenon in Large Language Model context window retrieval strategies\"\nPURPOSE: [Validates Context Positioning] Our `analysis_sets.yaml` uses a \"sandwich\" strategy for context injection. We need external research verifying that placing critical architectural definitions (like `MODEL.md`) at the beginning/end of the context window improves reasoning accuracy for large codebases.\nEXPECTED_SOURCES: [arXiv (AI/ML papers), Stanford/MIT CSAIL research, LLM provider technical reports (Anthropic/Google)]\n---"
