      "content": "We are developing a theory of PURPOSE in code. Key distinction: PURPOSE in human systems is DYNAMIC (flowing, adapting moment-to-moment to resolve incoherence). PURPOSE in code is CRYSTALLIZED (frozen at the moment of writing/committing). The code captures a snapshot of human intention at time t, but human purpose continues to evolve at t+1, t+2, etc. This creates DRIFT between crystallized code-purpose and dynamic human-purpose. Questions: 1) Is this distinction valid? 2) What are the implications for software evolution? 3) How does this relate to technical debt? 4) Is there a way to make code-purpose more dynamic, or is crystallization inherent to the medium?"
