MC-004 (Archive tools): Do repo_archaeologist.py, present_architect.py, future_visionary.py exist?\n4. HC-002 (Skipped tests): How many tests have @pytest.mark.skip?\n5. CC-002 (Reachability): Does topology_reasoning.py have entrypoint detection? What frameworks are supported?\n\nReturn updated confidence scores based on what you find."
