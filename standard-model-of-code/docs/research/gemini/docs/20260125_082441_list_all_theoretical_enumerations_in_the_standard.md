## Query

List ALL theoretical enumerations in the Standard Model: the 16-level Scale hierarchy, the 4 Phases, the Purpose hierarchy (pi levels), Q-score dimensions, RPBL dimensions. Give exact counts and names.

## Response

Based on the provided codebase context, here are the theoretical enumerations of the Standard Model of Code.

### 1. The 16-Level Scale Hierarchy (L-3 to L12)
*Source: `context-management/docs/archive/legacy_schema_2025/theory_v2.md`*

This hierarchy covers the physical, syntactic, semantic, systemic, and cosmological scales of code.

**Cosmological Scales**
*   **L12:** Universe (All code everywhere)
*   **L11:** Domain (Industry vertical)
*   **L10:** Organization (Company codebase)
*   **L9:** Platform (Infrastructure)
*   **L8:** Ecosystem (Connected systems)

**Systemic Scales**
*   **L7:** System (Deployable codebase)
*   **L6:** Package (Module/folder)
*   **L5:** File (Source file)
*   **L4:** Container (Class/struct)

**Semantic Scales**
*   **L3:** **Node** (Function/method) — *The Fundamental Atom*
*   **L2:** Block (Control structure)
*   **L1:** Statement (Instruction)

**Syntactic Scale**
*   **L0:** Token (Lexical unit)

**Physical Scales**
*   **L-1:** Character (Alphanumeric symbol)
*   **L-2:** Byte (8-bit unit)
*   **L-3:** Bit/Qubit (Classical or quantum bit)

### 2. The 4 Phases of Atoms
*Source: `context-management/docs/archive/legacy_schema_2025/theory_v2.md`*

The 200 atoms are categorized into these four fundamental phases of software existence.

1.  **DATA** (The matter of software)
2.  **LOGIC** (The forces of software)
3.  **ORGANIZATION** (The structure of software)
4.  **EXECUTION** (The dynamics of software)

### 3. The Purpose Field Hierarchy ($\pi_1 - \pi_4$)
*Source: `context-management/docs/ACI_DATASET_MANAGEMENT.md`*

Used for semantic graph matching and Adaptive Context Intelligence (ACI).

*   **$\pi_1$ (Atomic):** Role (e.g., Query, Validator, Repository)
*   **$\pi_2$ (Molecular):** Emergent purpose (e.g., Retrieve, Persist, Transform, Validate)
*   **$\pi_3$ (Organelle):** Container-level purpose (e.g., DataAccess, BusinessLogic, Integration)
*   **$\pi_4$ (System):** File-level purpose distribution

---

### 4. The Q-Score Dimensions (4D Confidence)
*Source: `context-management/docs/agent_school/AGENTKNOWLEDGEDUMP.md` & `DOCS_REORG_TASK_REGISTRY.md`*

Used to score the confidence of tasks and validation steps.

1.  **Factual:** Is the understanding of the current state correct?
2.  **Vision** (or Alignment): Does this serve the project mission?
3.  **Current:** Does this fit the codebase as it exists today?
4.  **Onwards:** Does this fit where the codebase is heading?

---

### 5. The RPBL Dimensions (Character Profile)
*Source: `context-management/docs/TOOL.md`*

A 4-dimensional profile used for quick characterization of code entities (derived from the full 8 Dimensions).

1.  **Responsibility** (R)
2.  **Purity** (P)
3.  **Boundary** (B)
4.  **Lifecycle** (L)

---

### 6. The 8 Dimensions (The Octahedral Atom)
*Source: `context-management/docs/archive/legacy_schema_2025/theory_v2.md`*

The full ontological classification system for every atom.

1.  **D1: WHAT** (Atom type, 1 of 200)
2.  **D2: LAYER** (Interface, Application, Core, Infrastructure, Test)
3.  **D3: ROLE** (Purpose, 1 of 33)
4.  **D4: BOUNDARY** (Internal, Input, I-O, Output)
5.  **D5: STATE** (Stateful, Stateless)
6.  **D6: EFFECT** (Pure, Read, Write, ReadModify)
7.  **D7: LIFECYCLE** (Create, Use, Destroy)
8.  **D8: TRUST** (Confidence level 0-100%)

### 7. The 8 Lenses (Epistemic Perspectives)
*Source: `context-management/docs/archive/legacy_schema_2025/theory_v2.md`*

The interrogative perspectives used to view any entity.

1.  **R1: IDENTITY** (What is it called?)
2.  **R2: ONTOLOGY** (What exists?)
3.  **R3: CLASSIFICATION** (What kind is it?)
4.  **R4: COMPOSITION** (How is it structured?)
5.  **R5: RELATIONSHIPS** (How is it connected?)
6.  **R6: TRANSFORMATION** (What does it do?)
7.  **R7: SEMANTICS** (What does it mean?)
8.  **R8: EPISTEMOLOGY** (How certain are we?)
