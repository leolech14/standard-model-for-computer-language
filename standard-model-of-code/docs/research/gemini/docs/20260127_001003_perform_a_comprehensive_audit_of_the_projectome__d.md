## Query

Perform a comprehensive audit of the PROJECTOME. Divide it into regions/zones. Specifically enumerate ALL theory documentation - every file that contains axioms, theorems, proofs, foundational concepts, or theoretical frameworks. Create a complete inventory organized by: 1) Fundamentals (axioms, primitives), 2) Core theory (main concepts), 3) Extended theory (derived concepts), 4) Specifications (implementation specs), 5) Research/validation. List every file path.

## Response

This is a comprehensive audit of the **PROJECTOME** ($P = C \sqcup X$), focused specifically on the **Contextome** ($X$) layer where theoretical frameworks are defined.

Based on the provided codebase context, here is the structural breakdown and the complete inventory of theory documentation.

# 3. CRITICAL OBSERVATIONS

1.  **Hemispheric Split:** Theory is intentionally split.
    *   **Body Theory** (`MODEL.md`, `COLLIDER.md`) lives in the *Particle* realm ($C$) because it defines the physics of the engine.
    *   **Brain Theory** (`CODESPACE_ALGEBRA.md`, `ACI_DATASET_MANAGEMENT.md`) lives in the *Wave* realm ($X$) because it defines the intelligence and potentiality.

2.  **The "Antimatter" Concept:** This is not just a bug list. It is a theoretical construct defined in `semantic_models.yaml` representing patterns that violate the fundamental physics of the project (e.g., "Context Myopia").

3.  **Missing/Referenced Files:** Several key theoretical documents are referenced in the context but their full content was not in the provided dump (though their existence is confirmed by the map):
    *   `context-management/docs/specs/AI_CONSUMER_CLASS.md`
    *   `context-management/docs/specs/OBSERVABILITY_TRIAD.md`
    *   `standard-model-of-code/schema/fixed/roles.json`
