## Response

Signal received. I have initialized the **PROJECT_elements** context.

I am ready to operate within the **Standard Model of Code** architecture:

*   **Particle Realm** (`standard-model-of-code/`): The Collider engine, 94 atoms, and measurement tools.
*   **Wave Realm** (`context-management/`): The ACI (Adaptive Context Intelligence), theory, and documentation.
*   **Observer Realm** (`.agent/`): The Task Registry, BARE engine, and governance protocols.

The system appears to be in **Phase 2: Intelligence**, with the "Sprint-001" executing.

Awaiting your command. You can ask me to:
1.  **Analyze** a part of the Codome (`./collider full ...`).
2.  **Query** the Contextome (ACI).
3.  **Claim** a task from the Registry.
4.  **Verify** symmetry between code and docs (HSL).
