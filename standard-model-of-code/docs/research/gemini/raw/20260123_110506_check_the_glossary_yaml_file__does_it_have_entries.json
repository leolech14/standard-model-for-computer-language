    "content": "Based on the codebase context provided, **I cannot check `GLOSSARY.yaml`** because that specific file was not included in the provided text. The context provided consists entirely of Python source files located in `standard-model-of-code/src/core/`.\n\nHowever, based on the definitions found in **`src/core/atom_registry.py`**, **`src/core/purpose_field.py`**, and **`src/core/purpose_emergence.py`**, I can tell you how these concepts are implemented programmatically in the system.\n\nHere is the status of these terms based on the **Python code implementation**:\n\n### 1. Abstraction\n*   **Status in File:** **Missing** (File not provided).\n*   **Code Context:** The code uses \"Abstraction\" conceptually (e.g., `Cache` is described as a \"Caching abstraction\" in `atom_registry.py`), but there is no specific data structure or enum defining \"Abstraction\" as a standalone entity.\n\n### 2. Levels of Abstraction\n*   **Status in File:** **Missing** (File not provided).\n*   **Code Context:** **Exists** under the term **\"Composition\"**.\n    *   Source: `src/core/atom_registry.py`\n    *   Definitions found:\n        *   **Atom**: Simple/Fundamental.\n        *   **Molecule**: Composite.\n        *   **Organelle**: Complex.\n\n### 3. Layers (Architectural)\n*   **Status in File:** **Missing** (File not provided).\n*   **Code Context:** **Exists**.\n    *   Source: `src/core/purpose_field.py` and `src/core/profile_loader.py`.\n    *   Definitions found (Clean Architecture standard):\n        *   **Presentation** (Interface)\n        *   **Application**\n        *   **Domain** (Core)\n        *   **Infrastructure**\n        *   **Testing**\n\n### 4. Scale / Levels\n*   **Status in File:** **Missing** (File not provided).\n*   **Code Context:** **Exists** as **\"Purpose Emergence Levels\"**.\n    *   Source: `src/core/purpose_emergence.py`\n    *   Definitions found:\n        *   **π₁ (PI_1)**: Atomic Purpose (Role)\n        *   **π₂ (PI_2)**: Molecular Purpose (Function/Method)\n        *   **π₃ (PI_3)**: Organelle Purpose (Class/Module)\n        *   **π₄ (PI_4)**: System Purpose (Package/Service)\n\n### 5. Containment Hierarchy\n*   **Status in File:** **Missing** (File not provided).\n*   **Code Context:** **Exists** implicitly via Graph Edges.\n    *   Source: `src/core/edge_extractor.py` and `src/core/unified_analysis.py`.\n    *   Definition: The code explicitly generates edges with `edge_type: 'contains'` (e.g., \"Class contains method, module contains class\").\n\n### Summary of Missing items (vs. Codebase Reality)\nSince the `GLOSSARY.yaml` file is missing from the context, I cannot confirm the text entries exists, but the **logic for 4 out of 5 of these concepts is strictly enforced in the Python code**. \"Abstraction\" is the only term used loosely rather than strictly defined as a programmatic constant.",
