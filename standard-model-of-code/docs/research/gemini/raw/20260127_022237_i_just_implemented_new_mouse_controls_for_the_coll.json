Is this control scheme aligned with the project's visualization principles?\n2. Are there any specifications or docs that should be updated to reflect this?\n3. What is the path forward - should this be documented, tested further, or integrated differently?\n4. Does this change need to be reflected in any other parts of the system (e.g., VISUALIZATION_UI_SPEC.md)?",

    "content": "Okay, I've analyzed your request and the provided codebase context. Here's a breakdown of my assessment and recommendations for integrating the new mouse controls into the Collider visualization:\n\n**1. Alignment with Project's Visualization Principles:**\n\nBased on the `context-management/docs/AI_USER_GUIDE.md`, `context-management/docs/specs/UI_REFACTOR_VISION.md`, and other documents, the proposed control scheme generally aligns with the project's visualization principles, particularly:\n\n*   **Usability:** The new controls provide intuitive ways to interact with the graph (selection, rotation, panning, zooming).\n*   **Responsiveness:** The controls should be responsive and provide immediate feedback to the user.\n*   **Discoverability:** The controls need to be clearly communicated to the user (e.g., through a help overlay or tooltips).\n\nHowever, the key is ensuring the implementation adheres to the overall philosophy of a \"boring, functional, discreet interface.\" The controls should not be flashy or distracting, but rather provide seamless and intuitive interaction.\n\n**2. Documentation Updates:**\n\nThe following files need to be updated to reflect the new control scheme:\n\n*   **.agent/intelligence/truths/repo_truths.yaml:** The `quick_counts` section might need to be updated if the number of controls has changed.\n*   **context-management/docs/AI_USER_GUIDE.md:** This guide *must* be updated to reflect the new controls. This is the primary reference for users.  The section on \"The Live Collaborator\" should be updated to reflect the new interaction methods.\n*   **standard-model-of-code/docs/COLLIDER.md:** This document should be updated in the \"Commands\" and \"Visualization Controls\" sections to reflect the new mouse controls. The \"Brain Download Sections\" may need updating if any of the core metrics have changed.\n*   **standard-model-of-code/docs/specs/UI_CONTROLS_SCHEMA.md:** This document needs to be updated to include the new controls in the schema.  Specifically, the \"Mouse Controls\" table needs to be updated.\n*   **standard-model-of-code/docs/specs/UI_LAYOUT_ARCHITECTURE.md:** Check the implementation details against the specifications in this document, especially regarding the use of  `modules/layout.js`, `bumpRender()`,  and the adherence to the rendering pipeline. Verify that the changes are reflected in the appropriate sections.\n\n**3. Path Forward:**\n\nThe suggested path forward should include:\n\n*   **Code Review:** The changes to `modules/registries/ControlRegistry.js`, `modules/selection.js`, and `app.js` should undergo careful code review.\n*   **Thorough Testing:**  Ensure that the new controls are functioning correctly and that existing functionality is not broken.  Specifically, test all combinations of mouse button + drag.\n*   **Documentation:** Update the relevant documentation files as listed above.\n*   **Accessibility Testing:** Ensure that the new controls are accessible to users with disabilities.\n\n**4. System Considerations:**\n\n*   **VISUALIZATION_UI_SPEC.md:** This document should be checked for references to the old control scheme. It may need to be updated to reflect the new controls.\n*   **modules/layout.js:** Ensure proper layout handling is in place for the new control elements\n*   **Accessibility testing:** Ensure that the new controls are accessible to users with disabilities.\n\n**Detailed Breakdown of Action Items:**\n\n*   **Prioritize Documentation Updates:** Given the scope and impact of the change, updating the core documentation files (`AI_USER_GUIDE.md`, `COLLIDER.md`, and `UI_CONTROLS_SCHEMA.md`) is the most important next step.\n*   **Implement Test Cases:** Create unit or integration tests, as appropriate, to test the new mouse control functionality in Javascript files.\n*   **Review and Update the UI Controls Schema (`.agent/schema/viz/tokens/controls.tokens.json`):**\n    *   Add new entries for the new mouse controls.\n    *   Ensure that the descriptions are clear and concise.\n    *   Verify that the data types and ranges are appropriate.\n*   **Update the `TOOLS_REGISTRY.yaml`:** If the new controls invoke any new tools, update the `TOOLS_REGISTRY.yaml` file to reflect these changes.\n*   **Validate with `analyze.py --verify`:** Use the HSL to verify that the changes do not violate any architectural constraints.\n*   **Consider a Feature Flag:** If there's any uncertainty, introduce a feature flag for the new control scheme that can be enabled or disabled.\n\n**In summary, focus on clear documentation, thorough testing, and adherence to the established architectural guidelines to ensure a successful integration of the new mouse controls.**\n",
