    "content": "Based on the divergence between the documented architecture (KERNEL/Manifest) and the actual filesystem state (86 registries found), here is the **Quick Win Matrix**.\n\nThese items are ranked by **ROI (Impact / Effort)**.\n\n### ⚡ Quick Win Matrix: Registry Remediation\n\n| Rank | Opportunity | Impact | Effort | Risk | What exactly to do |\n|:---|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---|\n| **1** | **Update Manifest Discovery Paths** | **HIGH** | **TRIVIAL** | NONE | **Concept:** The Agent relies on `.agent/manifest.yaml` to \"see\" the world. <br>**Action:** Update `manifest.yaml` under `agent_system.instances` to explicitly list the specific sub-directories where the \"hidden\" 26 registries reside (likely inside `legacy/`, `archive/`, or `tools/` subfolders) so the agent is at least *aware* of them. |\n| **2** | **Define the \"Contextome\"** | **HIGH** | **SMALL** | LOW | **Concept:** Missing \"Concept\" in the Particle/Wave duality. <br>**Action:** Create `context-management/docs/CONTEXTOME.md`. Define it formally as the \"sum total of all context management tools, docs, and semantic models.\" Add it to `SUBSYSTEM_INTEGRATION.md` as the overarching container for S2, S3, and S4. |\n| **3** | **Prune Empty Registries** | **MED** | **TRIVIAL** | NONE | **Concept:** Noise reduction.<br>**Action:** Run a script to identify and delete any of the 86 registry files (Markdown/YAML) that contain 0 bytes or only headers/comments. If a registry has no Items, it ceases to exist. |\n| **4** | **Corral \"Orphan\" Tasks** | **MED** | **SMALL** | LOW | **Concept:** Centralization.<br>**Action:** Create a directory `.agent/registry/unprocessed_legacy/`. Move any `.md` or `.yaml` file found in the scan that *looks* like a task list but isn't in `.agent/registry` or `src/` into this folder. This stops the \"86 registries\" sprawl instantly. |\n| **5** | **Ghost Run Cleanup** | **MED** | **SMALL** | MED | **Concept:** Stale state removal.<br>**Action:** Scan `.agent/runs/`. Identify RUN files older than 7 days that are not linked to an `active/` TASK. Move them to `.agent/runs/archive/orphaned/` to de-clutter the \"Active Context\" for agents. |\n| **6** | **Formalize \"Hidden\" Subsystems** | **MED** | **MED** | LOW | **Concept:** Integration mapping.<br>**Action:** The audit likely found tools not listed in `SUBSYSTEM_INTEGRATION.md` (e.g., helper scripts). Add them to the \"Subsystem Registry\" table in `SUBSYSTEM_INTEGRATION.md` as \"Utilities\" or \"Scripts\" so they are officially recognized assets. |\n| **7** | **Standardize Task Headers** | **HIGH** | **MED** | MED | **Concept:** Machine Readability.<br>**Action:** For the top 20 most active files in the 86 found, verify they have the YAML frontmatter required by `.agent/schema/task.schema.yaml`. If not, prepend a basic valid header so the BARE engine can read them. |\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Execution Plan for Top 3 Wins\n\n#### 1. Update Manifest Discovery (The \"Map Fix\")\nThe `manifest.yaml` currently only points to:\n```yaml\ninstances:\n  active_tasks: .agent/registry/active/\n  archived_tasks: .agent/registry/archive/\n```\n**Action:** Expand this list based on the audit findings.\n```yaml\ninstances:\n  active_tasks: .agent/registry/active/\n  legacy_pool: .agent/registry/legacy/      # NEW\n  tool_configs: context-management/config/  # NEW\n  research_logs: docs/research/             # NEW\n```\n\n#### 2. Define the Contextome (The \"Vocabulary Fix\")\nThe project has `standard-model-of-code` (Particle). It lacks the unified definition for the Wave side.\n**Action:** Create `context-management/docs/CONTEXTOME.md`:\n> **Definition:** The Contextome is the complete set of semantic relationships, documentation, and AI tooling that surrounds the Standard Model of Code.\n> **Constituents:**\n> 1. The Holographic Socratic Layer (HSL)\n> 2. The Analysis Engines (analyze.py)\n> 3. The External Connectors (Perplexity MCP)\n\n#### 3. Prune Empties (The \"Noise Fix\")\nRun this immediately to reduce the \"86 registries\" figure:\n```bash\nfind . -type f \\( -name \"*.md\" -o -name \"*.yaml\" \\) -size 0 -print -delete\n```\n*Note: This removes strictly empty files. Files with just a title need manual review (see Item 4).*",
