    "content": "Based on a static analysis of the provided codebase (`standard-model-of-code`), here is the Comprehensive Project Health Check.\n\n### 1. File Count by Category\nBased on the provided context, the codebase is heavily weighted towards Python core logic and YAML configuration schemas.\n\n*   **Source Code (.py):** 12 files\n    *   *Core Logic:* 10 files (Extractors, Classifiers, Engines)\n    *   *Orchestration:* 2 files (`full_analysis.py`, `unified_analysis.py`)\n*   **Configuration/Schemas (.yaml):** 6 files\n    *   *Constraints:* 2 files\n    *   *Profiles:* 4 files\n*   **Documentation (.md):** 0 files (visible in context, though referenced in comments).\n*   **Tests (`test_*.py`):** 0 files.\n    *   *Note:* There are no dedicated test files visible. Testing appears to rely on `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` blocks inside source files.\n\n### 2. Dead Code & Orphaned Modules\nThere are specific indicators of dead or \"zombie\" code that have been explicitly marked but not removed.\n\n*   **`src/core/universal_detector.py`:** This file appears to be a legacy entry point. It contains commented-out imports marked as `# QUARANTINED` (e.g., `ParticleClassifier`, `DependencyAnalyzer`). It overlaps significantly with `full_analysis.py` but uses deprecated or disabled components.\n*   **Quarantined Logic in `unified_analysis.py`:**\n    *   Stage 2 (RPBL Classification) is explicitly marked `[SKIPPED - QUARANTINED]` in the code comments, with the `ParticleClassifier` logic commented out.\n*   **Redundant Logic:** `heuristic_classifier.py` and `universal_classifier.py` share overlapping responsibilities regarding role detection (e.g., identifying \"Factory\" or \"Service\" patterns).\n\n### 3. Documentation Coverage\n**Status: High (A-)**\n\nThe codebase exhibits excellent inline documentation standards.\n*   **Module Level:** Every Python file includes a high-level docstring describing its purpose, usage, and outputs.\n*   **Class/Function Level:** Key methods (e.g., `classify_disconnection`, `validate_graph`) have detailed docstrings explaining parameters and return values.\n*   **Self-Describing Data:** The YAML files (`rules.yaml`, `taxonomy.yaml`) act as documentation for the architectural rules engine, effectively serving as \"executable documentation.\"\n\n### 4. Test Coverage Status\n**Status: Critical (D)**\n\n*   **Formal Tests:** 0% visible. No `tests/` directory or `test_*.py` files were provided in the context.\n*   **Smoke Tests:** 60%. Most core files (e.g., `constraint_engine.py`, `dimension_classifier.py`) contain `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` blocks that run basic scenarios. While this ensures the file runs, it does not constitute a regression test suite.\n*   **Risk:** The heavy reliance on regex and tree-sitter queries without a formal test suite makes refactoring high-risk, particularly for `edge_extractor.py` which handles complex AST parsing.\n\n### 5. Technical Debt Indicators\n\n*   **Monolithic Orchestrator:** `src/core/full_analysis.py` is approximately 1,000 lines long. It handles CLI parsing, file orchestration, timing, graph analytics, and HTML generation. This violates the Single Responsibility Principle and should be refactored (e.g., moving `Codome` logic to a dedicated module).\n*   **Error Swallowing:** There is a prevalence of broad `try...except Exception` blocks inside loops (e.g., in `full_analysis.py` loops for `detect_js_imports` and `analyze_scopes`). While this prevents the tool from crashing on a single bad file, it masks underlying parsing failures.\n*   **Dynamic Imports:** `unified_analysis.py` uses try/except blocks to import optional dependencies (like `llm_classifier`). This makes static analysis of the tool itself difficult and dependency management fragile.\n*   **Legacy/Zombie Code:** As noted in section 2, the presence of \"QUARANTINED\" code paths suggests incomplete refactoring.\n\n### 6. Overall Health Score: 72/100\n\n| Category | Score | Notes |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Architecture** | 85/100 | Strong domain modeling (Standard Model atoms, RPBL). Clear separation of schema vs. logic. |\n| **Code Quality** | 75/100 | Well-typed python, good naming conventions, but `full_analysis.py` is too large. |\n| **Documentation** | 95/100 | Excellent inline docs and schema descriptions. |\n| **Testing** | 15/100 | Use of `__main__` blocks is insufficient for a project of this complexity. |\n| **Maintainability** | 90/100 | The use of YAML profiles to drive logic makes the system highly configurable without code changes. |\n\n**Recommendation:**\n1.  Delete `src/core/universal_detector.py`.\n2.  Extract the `Codome` logic and `Report Generation` logic out of `full_analysis.py` into their own modules.\n3.  Formalize the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` blocks into a proper `pytest` suite.",
