    "content": "Okay, I will analyze the provided files to create a comprehensive map of the PROJECT_elements repository. Here's the summary, structured as requested:\n\n**1. Project Purpose:**\n\nThe mission of PROJECT_elements is to find the basic constituents of computer programs, creating a Standard Model of Code that enables advanced code analysis and AI-driven automation. This involves transforming raw repository content into distilled, addressable knowledge atoms.\n\n**2. Key Components and Their Relationships:**\n\nPROJECT_elements is structured around a particle/wave architecture, with three primary subsystems:\n\n*   **Particle (standard-model-of-code/):** This is the \"doing\" layer, collapsing potential into concrete analysis. It contains the Collider engine, which performs semantic code analysis to generate ground truth in the form of `unified_analysis.json`. The Collider breaks code into structural atoms and reassembles patterns. It implements the following stages:\n\n    *   AST Parsing\n    *   RPBL Classification\n    *   Auto Pattern Discovery\n    *   Edge Extraction\n    *   Graph Inference\n    *   Unified Output\n\n*   **Wave (context-management/):** This is the \"thinking\" layer, focusing on AI tools and context management. It includes:\n\n    *   `analyze.py`: An AI query interface that implements the Holographic Socratic Layer (HSL).\n    *   `HSL`: The Holographic Socratic Layer, responsible for automated validation rules and detecting drift.\n    *   `Perplexity MCP`: A utility for external knowledge queries.\n    *   `Laboratory Bridge`: Allows communication between the \"Wave\" and \"Particle\" subsystems.\n\n*   **Observer (.agent/):** This is the \"governance\" layer, responsible for task management and coordination. It includes:\n\n    *   Task Registry: Tracks work items and their status.\n    *   BARE (Background Auto-Refinement Engine): An engine for background auto-refinement of the codebase.\n    *   Archive/Mirror: Utility for cloud sync to GCS.\n    *   Cloud Automation: Tools for auto-boosting opportunities via GCS + Cloud Function.\n\n**Relationship between components:**\n\n1.  Code Commit -> Collider generates `unified_analysis.json`.\n2.  `unified_analysis.json` is used by `analyze.py` to perform queries and generate tasks.\n3.  Tasks are claimed by BARE, which generates fixes.\n4.  HSL validates the semantic models.\n5.  The Macro System records action patterns for automation.\n6. The Autonomous Enrichment Pipeline (AEP) enriches opportunities and promotes them to tasks.\n\n**3. Documentation Structure:**\n\n*   **Core Documentation:**\n    *   `KERNEL.md`: Bootstrap context for all AI agents.\n    *   `SUBSYSTEM_INTEGRATION.md`: Canonical map of subsystem connections.\n    *   `manifest.yaml`: Machine-readable discovery metadata.\n*   **Design Specifications:** Located in `.agent/specs/` and `context-management/docs/specs/`. They outline the architecture and functionality of various subsystems.\n*   **Theory:** Located in `standard-model-of-code/docs/`. This includes `MODEL.md` and related documents, which define the Standard Model of Code and its underlying principles.\n*   **Operational Docs:** Located in `context-management/docs/`. These include guides on using AI tools, setting up the environment, and running analyses.\n*   **Task Registry:** Located in `.agent/registry/`. This is a dashboard for tracking tasks and opportunities.\n\n**4. Theory vs. Implementation Alignment:**\n\n*   The project strives for wave-particle symmetry, where every concept in the theory has a corresponding implementation in the code.\n*   The Holographic-Socratic Layer (`analyze.py --verify`) is used to automatically validate the codebase against defined invariants.\n*   The `repo_truths.yaml` file contains DERIVED facts validated by BARE/TruthValidator, ensuring that the repository state aligns with the project's goals.\n*   The Decision Deck Layer constrains agent actions to a curated library of certified moves, ensuring that actions align with project goals.\n\n**5. Known Issues and Gaps:**\n\n*   **S5 → S6 (BARE cannot poll tasks):** The BARE engine cannot currently poll tasks from the Task Registry, creating a gap in automation.\n*   **Batch Grade (S11) - FAIL-001:** The Batch Grade experiment failed due to running with the `grade` command instead of `full`, missing the `unified_analysis.json` file.\n*   **Cloud Automation (S10) - PENDING DEPLOY:** The Cloud Automation tools are pending deployment to GCP.\n*   **HSL vs analyze.py --verify:** The conceptual framework (HSL) and the execution engine (`analyze.py --verify`) are distinct but related, requiring careful management.\n*   **Task Registry Format:** The current Task Registry format uses Markdown files, which are human-readable but machine-fragile. A migration to structured YAML is proposed.\n*   **AEP Cloud Deployment**: The Autonomous Enrichment Pipeline (AEP) is not yet fully deployed to the cloud.\n*   **Limited Macro System:** The macro system is planned but not fully implemented, lacking a trigger engine for auto-execution.\n*   **Orphaned Batch Script:** The `standard-model-of-code/tools/batch_grade/grade` script is an orphan script and should be updated/removed.\n\nThis comprehensive map should provide a solid foundation for further work on PROJECT_elements.\n",
