    "query": "SYNTHESIS: What Should We Call This and How Should We Think About It?\n\nWe have established through this inquiry:\n\n1. AUTOMATION vs MODULE distinction:\n   - MODULE = Code that DOES the work (Capability, first-order)\n   - AUTOMATION = Code that REMEMBERS to do the work (Policy, second-order, 'hacks')\n\n2. The three levels of being:\n   - Level 1: PROSTHETIC (current) - external scripts polling (hacks/loops)\n   - Level 2: NATIVE - system exposes hooks, automation as plugins\n   - Level 3: PROJECTOME - automation as intrinsic property of data\n\n3. Cloud is NOT the differentiator - it's just a runtime context\n   - Local automation = ephemeral autonomy\n   - Cloud automation = persistent autonomy\n\n4. Current state: We're building 'Life Support' for a Projectome that hasn't woken up\n\nNOW THE PRACTICAL QUESTION:\n\nGiven all this, what do we CALL this collection of scripts?\n- NOT 'Automation Module' (too small, wrong ontology)\n- NOT 'Autonomic System' (too grandiose for Level 1 hacks)\n- NOT 'Machinery' (industrial, not physics)\n\nOPTIONS based on our analysis:\n\nA. 'LIFE SUPPORT' - The temporary scaffolding keeping the system alive\nB. 'PROSTHETICS' - External hacks compensating for missing native capability\nC. 'LOOPS' - Simple, honest, describes what they are\nD. 'DAEMON CONSTELLATION' - Background processes working together\nE. 'TRIGGER LAYER' - The event-driven execution surface\nF. 'OPERATIONAL HACKS' - Embracing the 'workaround' nature\nG. Something else entirely?\n\nAlso: Should we document this ontology formally?\n- Add to GLOSSARY: MODULE vs AUTOMATION distinction\n- Add to THEORY: The three levels (Prosthetic → Native → Projectome)\n- Add to ROADMAP: Migration path from Level 1 → Level 2 → Level 3\n\nWhat is your final recommendation for NAMING and FRAMING this?",

    "content": "Based on the synthesis of the \"Prosthetic vs. Native\" distinction and the current evolutionary stage of the project, here is the recommendation for Naming, Framing, and Documentation.\n\n### 1. The Name\n**Recommendation: THE AUTONOMIC LAYER (or \"Autonomics\")**\n\n**Why this works:**\n*   **Biological Metaphor:** It fits the \"Standard Model\" (Physics/Biology). The Autonomic Nervous System controls unconscious, vital functions (heartbeat, breathing, digestion) just as these scripts control the repo's vital signs (sync, audit, verify).\n*   **Scale Appropriate:** It implies automaticity *without* implying high-level intelligence or \"consciousness\" (which belongs to the Agent/Observer).\n*   **Bridge:** It works for Level 1 (Prosthetic Autonomics, like an Iron Lung) and Level 2 (Native Autonomics, like a pacemaker or actual lungs).\n\n### 2. The Framing\n**Concept: \"Life Support for a Sleeping Projectome\"**\n\nWe frame the current collection of scripts not as \"features,\" but as **Prosthetic Life Support**.\n\n*   **The Patient (Projectome):** Currently comatose. It cannot breathe (sync) or regulate its temperature (structure) on its own.\n*   **The Machinery (Scripts):** An external \"Iron Lung\" that forces air in and out (git hooks, crons).\n*   **The Goal:** To surgically implant these capabilities until the patient wakes up (Level 3) and breathes on its own.\n\n### 3. Implementation\n\n#### A. Directory Structure (Refactoring)\nTo formalize this, create a clear home for these scripts within the `.agent` (Observer) realm.\n\n**Current:**\n`.agent/tools/` (Generic, mixed bag)\n\n**Proposed:**\n`.agent/autonomics/`\n  ├── `reflexes/` (Fast, event-driven: post-commit, drift-guard)\n  ├── `rhythms/` (Time-driven: daily audits, cron jobs)\n  └── `life_support/` (The \"Rig\": setup, external polling, daemons)\n\n#### B. Formal Documentation\n\n**Yes, you must document this.** It is a fundamental shift in how we view \"tooling.\"\n\n**1. Add to `GLOSSARY.md`:**\n\n| Term | Definition |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Module** | Code that possesses a *capability* (e.g., \"Can analyze graph\"). First-order function. |\n| **Autonomics** | Code that possesses *policy/memory* (e.g., \"Remembers to analyze graph every hour\"). Second-order function. |\n| **Homoeostasis** | The state of balance (Symmetry) maintained by the Autonomic Layer. |\n\n**2. Add to `THEORY.md` (The Three Levels of Being):**\n\n> **The Evolution of Repository Agency**\n>\n> 1.  **Level 1: PROSTHETIC (Life Support)**\n>     *   *Mechanism:* External scripts polling and poking the code.\n>     *   *Nature:* \"Hacks\" and \"Loops.\" Fragile.\n>     *   *Example:* A python script running in a terminal window watching file timestamps.\n>\n> 2.  **Level 2: NATIVE (The Nervous System)**\n>     *   *Mechanism:* The system exposes event hooks; automation is a plugin.\n>     *   *Nature:* Integrated. Resilient.\n>     *   *Example:* A Git hook that triggers a WASM module inside the editor; A CI pipeline that blocks merge on semantic drift.\n>\n> 3.  **Level 3: PROJECTOME (Intrinsic Life)**\n>     *   *Mechanism:* Automation is a property of the data itself.\n>     *   *Nature:* Alive.\n>     *   *Example:* The code *refuses* to compile if it drifts from the spec. The documentation *updates itself* upon save.\n\n**3. Add to `ROADMAP.md`:**\n\n**Strategic Objective: Wean the System off Life Support**\n*   **Current:** Maintain Level 1 Prosthetics (Daemon Constellation).\n*   **Next:** Move critical reflexes (Drift Guard) to Level 2 (Native hooks/CI).\n*   **Vision:** Encode policy into the AST (Level 3).\n\n### 4. Summary for the \"Identity Card\"\n\nWhen an Agent asks \"What is this script?\", the answer is now:\n\n> \"This is a **Prosthetic Reflex** in the **Autonomic Layer**. It provides **Life Support** to the Projectome by externally forcing [Action] to occur when [Trigger] happens, because the system cannot yet do this natively.\"\n\n### Final Verdict on your Options:\n*   Use **Option A (LIFE SUPPORT)** as the descriptive metaphor for the *current state*.\n*   Use **Option B (PROSTHETICS)** to describe the *nature* of the scripts.\n*   Use **\"AUTONOMICS\"** as the formal *Name*.",
