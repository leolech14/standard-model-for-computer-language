    "content": "Okay, here's a summary of the implementation roadmap, based on the provided files:\n\n**Overall Goal:** Implement and validate several researched theoretical concepts into the Collider tool, focusing on improving code analysis and providing insights into code structure, flow, evolvability, and potential issues. The guiding principles are that research must back implementation, questions are valued, theory guides practice, and Tree-sitter's capabilities are key.\n\n**Phases:**\n\n1.  **RESEARCH (Current Priority):** Deep dives into Network Centrality, Evolvability Measurement, Interface Surface, and Flow Substances. Each area involves research questions, methods, and documentation of findings in specific markdown files.\n2.  **DOCUMENTATION (Parallel with Research):** Maintaining living documents (`THEORY_EXPANSION_2026.md`, `RESEARCH_DIRECTIONS.md`, `MODEL.md`, `TREE_SITTER_INTEGRATION_SPEC.md`) with a focus on questions, evidence, confidence levels, and traceability.\n3.  **IMPLEMENTATION (After Research):** Implementing validated concepts.  Network Centrality is deemed ready for implementation, while Tree-sitter Scope Analysis and Evolvability Score need further research.\n4.  **COLLIDER INTEGRATION:** Enhancing Collider output with new theory additions, providing user value by highlighting critical paths, change safety zones, module contracts, and data flow. This involves changes to `output.md` and the visualization (HTML).\n5.  **VALIDATION:**  Before implementation, define a hypothesis, experiment with real codebases, measure correlations, document findings, and only implement if supported by research. Validation codebases include Collider itself, express.js, lodash, and a monolith.\n\n**Key Areas of Implementation:**\n\n*   **Network Centrality:** Computing centrality metrics (betweenness, closeness, PageRank) and using them to identify critical paths and potential problems.\n*   **Tree-sitter Scope Analysis:** Using Tree-sitter to analyze scope boundaries and detect interface surfaces.\n*   **Evolvability Score:** Developing a formula to measure evolvability based on coupling, interface stability, test coverage, and centrality risk.\n*   **Flow Substances:** Tracking data and control flow to understand how information moves through the system.\n*   **Disconnection Taxonomy:** Moving from simply labeling \"orphans\" to classifying disconnection into meaningful categories (dead code, entry points, test fixtures, etc).\n\n**Specific Action Items (from \"Current Action Items\" in `RESEARCH_TO_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md`):**\n\n*   Correlate `topology_role` with git history (change frequency, bug fixes).\n*   Implement betweenness centrality and PageRank in `full_analysis.py`.\n*   Investigate orphan nodes (dead code analysis).\n*   Longer term items are evolvability formula validation, interface surface detection via Tree-sitter scopes, and NST element mapping to SMC atoms.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nThe roadmap outlines a structured process for incorporating theoretical research into a practical tool (Collider), emphasizing the importance of validation and a deep understanding of the underlying concepts. The focus is on turning abstract ideas into measurable metrics and actionable insights for developers. There's also a strong emphasis on leveraging Tree-sitter for its code intelligence capabilities.  The process is iterative, with research informing implementation, and implementation driving further research.\n",
