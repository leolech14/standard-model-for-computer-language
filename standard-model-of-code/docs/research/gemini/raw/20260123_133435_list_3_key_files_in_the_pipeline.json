    "content": "Based on the **`analysis_sets.yaml`** configuration and **`COLLIDER_ARCHITECTURE.md`**, here are 3 key files in the analysis pipeline:\n\n1.  **`standard-model-of-code/src/core/full_analysis.py`**\n    *   **Role:** The main pipeline orchestrator and driver.\n    *   **Why:** Listed as a **critical file** in the `pipeline` analysis set. It coordinates the 12-stage analysis process, managing the flow from parsing to output generation.\n\n2.  **`standard-model-of-code/src/core/unified_analysis.py`**\n    *   **Role:** The core analysis engine (Stages 1-6).\n    *   **Why:** Handles the \"Unified Analysis\" phase, including AST parsing, RPBL classification, and auto-pattern discovery before passing data to the full analysis context.\n\n3.  **`standard-model-of-code/src/core/edge_extractor.py`**\n    *   **Role:** Relationship builder.\n    *   **Why:** Explicitly included in the `pipeline` analysis set. It is responsible for determining connections (calls, imports, inheritance) between nodes, which is essential for constructing the semantic graph.",
