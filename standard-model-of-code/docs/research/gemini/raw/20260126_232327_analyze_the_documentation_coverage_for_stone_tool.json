    "content": "Based on the codebase context provided, here is the analysis of the documentation coverage for **Stone Tool Principle** and **TOOLOME**.\n\n### Executive Summary\n**Status:** **Partially Integrated / Theoretical Drift**\nThe concepts are well-defined in high-level theory (`CODESPACE_ALGEBRA` and `GLOSSARY`) but lack integration into the core topological definitions (`PROJECTOME`, `CODOME`) and operational guides.\n\nThere is a specific definition mismatch: `TOOLOME` appears in the Glossary but is mathematically absent from the Algebra that supposedly governs the project structure.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Where is it Documented?\n\nThe concepts exist in two primary locations:\n\n| File | Section | Depth | Content |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **`context-management/docs/CODESPACE_ALGEBRA.md`** | **§15 Consumer Classes** | **High** | Defines **Axiom H4 (Stone Tool Principle)**: \"Tools MAY be designed that humans cannot directly use.\" Defines the \"Stone Tool Test\". |\n| **`context-management/docs/GLOSSARY.md`** | **Consumer Classes** | **Medium** | Defines `TOOLOME` vs `STONE_TOOLS`. Defines the \"Interface Level\" (Axiom H5). |\n\n---\n\n### 2. Analysis of Gaps & Disconnects\n\n#### A. The \"Toolome\" Algebraic Gap\nIn `CODESPACE_ALGEBRA.md`, the universe is partitioned into `P = C ⊔ X` (Codome ⊔ Contextome).\n*   **The Issue:** The **TOOLOME** (defined in Glossary as \"Development Tools\") and **STONE_TOOLS** (\"Analysis Tools\") are **not mathematically located** in this partition.\n*   **Implication:** Since tools are executable, they technically belong to the `CODOME` ($C$), but the Algebra treats $C$ primarily as the \"System under observation,\" not the \"Observer.\"\n*   **Missing Logic:** There is no set-theoretic definition for where the tools themselves live. Is `analyze.py` part of the Codome it analyzes?\n\n#### B. The \"Phantom\" Specifications\nThe `GLOSSARY.md` references two documents that describe these concepts in detail, but they do not appear in the file list or the provided context:\n1.  `docs/specs/AI_CONSUMER_CLASS.md` (Referenced as \"Full Axiom H specification\")\n2.  `standard-model-of-code/context-management/docs/deep/THEORY_AMENDMENT_2026-01.md` (Referenced for \"TOOLOME integration\")\n*   **Status:** **PHANTOM**. These appear to be missing or un-indexed files.\n\n#### C. Operational Disconnect\nThe `AI_USER_GUIDE.md` describes how to *use* the tools (\"The Surgeon\", \"The Architect\"), but it fails to categorize them using the Stone Tool terminology.\n*   **Gap:** It does not warn human users that `unified_analysis.json` is a \"Stone Tool\" output intended for AI consumption, not human reading. This misses a key opportunity to set user expectations regarding ergonomics.\n\n#### D. The Projectome Definition Gap\n`PROJECTOME.md` defines the universe as `CODOME` and `CONTEXTOME`. It mentions \"Tools\" under the domains list but does not recognize `TOOLOME` as a formal sub-universe or domain.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Terminology Logic Check\n\nThere is a slight friction in the definitions between `CODESPACE_ALGEBRA` and `GLOSSARY`:\n\n*   **In Algebra:** The distinction is purely about **Ergonomics** (Axiom H4: \"Can a human use without AI mediation?\").\n*   **In Glossary:** The distinction becomes **Taxonomical** (`TOOLOME` = Dev Tools, `STONE_TOOLS` = Analysis Tools).\n\n**Contradiction Risk:** A formatter (Dev Tool) could be a Stone Tool if it's purely JSON-config driven and complex. The Glossary implies a functional split, while the Algebra implies an interface split.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Recommendations\n\nTo resolve these gaps and ensure proper cross-referencing:\n\n1.  **Update `PROJECTOME.md`**: Explicitly locate the `TOOLOME` within the Codome.\n    *   *Proposed Math:* $C = S \\sqcup T$ (Codome = Source ⊔ Toolome).\n2.  **Integrate into `AI_USER_GUIDE.md`**: Add a \"Stone Tool Warning\" section explaining that certain outputs (like the 25MB JSON blobs) are intentionally hostile to human readers because they are optimized for AI agents (Axiom H3).\n3.  **Resolve Phantom Docs**: Either create `docs/specs/AI_CONSUMER_CLASS.md` or move its core content into `CODESPACE_ALGEBRA.md` to avoid dead pointers.\n4.  **Refine `GLOSSARY.md`**: Clarify if `TOOLOME` refers to *all* tools, or specifically *human-usable* tools. Currently, it ambiguously separates `TOOLOME` from `STONE_TOOLS`.\n\n### Final Verdict\nThe **Stone Tool Principle** is theoretically sound but mathematically orphaned. It exists as a philosophical axiom in `CODESPACE_ALGEBRA` but has not yet been reconciled with the set theory that defines the rest of the project structure.",
