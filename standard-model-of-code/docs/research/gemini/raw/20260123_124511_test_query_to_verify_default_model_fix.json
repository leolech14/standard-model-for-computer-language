    "content": "Based on the codebase context, here's an analysis of the user's request and how to address it:\n\n**User Request:**  The user wants to run a test query to verify a fix related to the default model.  This implies they suspect the default model selection or behavior is incorrect and want to confirm their fix resolves the issue.\n\n**Codebase Analysis and Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify Relevant Code:** The `full_analysis.py` file is the primary entry point.  Specifically, the `run_full_analysis` function is what the user is likely executing.  Within `run_full_analysis`, the `_generate_ai_insights` function uses Vertex AI Gemini and is likely where the \"default model\" is being specified or used.\n2.  **Locate Default Model Logic:** Look at `_generate_ai_insights`.  The `model = options.get('ai_insights_model', 'gemini-2.0-flash-001')` line shows where the default AI model is defined and retrieved. `options.get('ai_insights_model', ...)` retrieves the value from the `options` dictionary, and if the key doesn't exist then returns the string `'gemini-2.0-flash-001'`.\n3.  **Craft a Test Query:**\n    *   **Goal:** The test query should explicitly avoid setting the `ai_insights_model` option.  This will force the code to use the default model.\n    *   **Execution:** Execute the `run_full_analysis` function with this tailored `options` dictionary.\n    *   **Verification:** Inspect the output to ensure that the code path utilizing the default model executes correctly. Check the ai_insights part of the full_output to ensure that the default model was actually used and that the generated insights are valid. The output of the `subprocess.run` call is the place to start to check if there are errors. Look at the logged timing output to see if the AI Insights stage was completed and the timing.\n4.  **Considerations:**\n    *   **Dependencies:** Generating AI insights requires Vertex AI to be configured correctly. The test could fail due to authentication or quota issues with Vertex AI.\n    *   **Error Handling:** The `_generate_ai_insights` function already includes error handling. The test should verify that these error conditions are not triggered when using the default model.\n    *   **Context:** The user likely has a specific codebase in mind for testing. The test query should be run against that codebase.\n    *   **Edge Cases**: Consider edge cases like: providing an invalid target path, or a path with no code. These will help determine if the default model logic handles these gracefully.\n    *   **AI Model Availability**: Verify that the default AI model exists and is available in the user's Vertex AI project. This is because it is possible the AI model has been removed from Vertex AI.\n\n**Example Test Query and Verification Steps:**\n\n```python\n# Example (assuming this is part of a test suite or script)\n\nfrom src.core.full_analysis import run_full_analysis\nimport os\n\ndef test_default_ai_model():\n    # 1. Define target path (replace with a suitable test codebase)\n    target_path = \"/path/to/your/test/codebase\"  # <---- REPLACE THIS\n\n    # 2. Construct options WITHOUT 'ai_insights_model'\n    options = {\n        \"ai_insights\": True,\n        # \"ai_insights_model\": \"other-model\",  # Intentionally commented out.\n    }\n\n    # 3. Run analysis\n    full_output = run_full_analysis(target_path, options=options)\n\n    # 4. Verify (check for errors, correct model, valid output)\n    assert \"ai_insights\" in full_output, \"AI insights were not generated\"\n\n    # Access the model used.\n    try:\n        ai_insights = full_output[\"ai_insights\"]\n        # If AI insights returned an error instead of generating insights, log and fail\n        if isinstance(ai_insights, dict) and \"error\" in ai_insights:\n            print(f\"AI Insights returned an error: {ai_insights['error']}\")\n            assert False, \"AI Insights returned an error.\"\n\n        # Check to ensure the default model name is in the command line sent to analyze.py\n        # This is a brittle test, as it relies on the command line to be formatted exactly in a certain way.\n        # A more robust approach would be to patch _generate_ai_insights and mock the call.\n        command_line = ai_insights['metadata']['command_line']\n        assert 'gemini-2.0-flash-001' in command_line\n\n    except KeyError:\n        assert False, \"metadata/command_line fields not found in ai_insights output\"\n\n    # Verify the AI insights output. A more robust approach is to check the correctness\n    # of the output for a known codebase.\n\n    print(\"Default AI Model Test Passed!\")\n\n# Run the test (if it's not part of a test framework)\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    test_default_ai_model()\n\n```\n\n**Explanation of the Test:**\n\n*   **`target_path`:**  This *must* be replaced with the path to a valid codebase on your system.  A minimal example repo is fine.\n*   **`options`:** The key here is that `ai_insights_model` is *not* set. This forces `_generate_ai_insights` to use its default.\n*   **`assert \"ai_insights\" in full_output`:** Verifies the AI insights stage ran at all.\n*  **`ai_insights['metadata']['command_line']`:** Checks whether the default model string is in the command line sent to `analyze.py`.\n*  **The \"Default AI Model Test Passed!\" log shows when the test passes.**\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n*   **Vertex AI Configuration:** Make absolutely sure you have set up Vertex AI correctly, including authentication and project selection.\n*   **Error Checking:** Add more specific `assert` statements to verify the *content* of the `ai_insights` output. You'll need to know what to expect from your test codebase.\n*   **Brittle tests:**  Tests which rely on specific strings being present in the generated code are brittle. They are likely to break when the underlying implementation details change. Consider mocking the AI Insights generation step instead.\n\nThis detailed plan should help the user verify their fix for the default AI model selection.\n",
