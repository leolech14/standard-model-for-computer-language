    "content": "Based on the codebase analysis, here is the comprehensive list of all names, acronyms, and terms used to refer to the cloud-based AI automation layer, categorized by their architectural scope.\n\n### 1. The Core Acronyms (The 5 Engines)\nThese are the specific processing units defined in `BACKGROUND_AI_LAYER_MAP.md`.\n\n*   **BARE** - **Background Auto-Refinement Engine**\n    *   *Also referred to as:* \"The Hands,\" \"Self-Refinement.\"\n    *   *Function:* Handles post-commit truths, confidence boosting, and task claiming.\n*   **HSL** - **Holographic-Socratic Layer**\n    *   *Also referred to as:* \"The Critic,\" \"Socratic Audit.\"\n    *   *Function:* Semantic validation against \"Antimatter Laws\" to detect architectural drift.\n*   **AEP** - **Autonomous Enrichment Pipeline**\n    *   *Function:* Transforms raw opportunities (Inbox) into validated tasks via research loops.\n*   **ACI** - **Adaptive Context Intelligence**\n    *   *Function:* The context curation system (\"Curriculum Compiler\") that selects optimal datasets for AI queries.\n*   **REFINERY** - **Context Refinery**\n    *   *Also referred to as:* \"Meta-Solution,\" \"RefineryNode.\"\n    *   *Function:* Atomizes code into semantic units (chunks) for RAG and caching.\n\n### 2. Overarching Architectural Terms\nThese terms refer to the entire system of background processing.\n\n*   **Background AI Data Processing Layer** (Canonical name in `BACKGROUND_AI_LAYER_MAP.md`)\n*   **The Brain** (Used in `manifest.yaml` and architecture docs to contrast with \"The Body\" / Collider).\n*   **Intelligence Layer (Wave)** (Used in `KERNEL.md` to describe the potential/field vs the particle/implementation).\n*   **Adaptive Intelligence Layer** (Used in `registry/INDEX.md` referring to Phase 10).\n*   **Repository Context System** (Used in `REPOSITORY_CONTEXT_SYSTEM.md`).\n*   **Context Management** (The directory name `context-management/` containing these tools).\n\n### 3. Functional Personas (Role-Based Names)\nThe documentation frequently personifies these automation tools based on their behavior.\n\n*   **The Critic** (HSL running semantic verification).\n*   **The Cartographer** (The `continuous_cartographer.py` tool running mapping).\n*   **The Guardian** (A specific mode of the cartographer that triggers on file changes).\n*   **The Researcher** (Manual trigger mode for external Perplexity queries).\n*   **The Surgeon** (Forensic analysis mode).\n*   **The Architect** (Global reasoning mode).\n*   **The Observer** (The agent kernel component that decides what to measure).\n*   **Antigravity** (The name of the AI Agent listed as the \"Auditor\" in `REPOSITORY_AUDIT_2026-01-19.md`).\n\n### 4. Infrastructure & Implementation Terms\nTerms used in config files, scripts, and deployment manuals.\n\n*   **HSL Daemon** (The continuous background process).\n*   **Quartet Watchdog** (The 6-hour schedule defined in `HOLOGRAPHIC_DEPLOYMENT_MANUAL.md`).\n*   **Socratic Audit Job** (The Cloud Run job name).\n*   **Curriculum Compiler** (Used in `ACI_DATASET_MANAGEMENT.md` to describe data preparation).\n*   **TruthValidator** (Component of BARE).\n*   **ConfidenceBooster** (Component of BARE).\n*   **Centripetal Scan** (Deep 12-round analysis tool).\n\n### 5. Historical / Legacy Terms\nTerms found in timeline analysis or older docs but still present.\n\n*   **Spectrometer** (Original name for the analysis engine before \"Collider\").\n*   **Alien Architecture** (Used in `AI_USER_GUIDE.md` to describe the non-standard topology).\n*   **Decision Deck Layer** (A proposed governance layer in `TASK-018.yaml`).\n\n### Summary Hierarchy\n\n```text\nThe Brain / Intelligence Layer (The System)\n├── BARE (The Hands - Fixes things)\n├── HSL (The Critic - Validates things)\n├── AEP (The Planner - Enriches tasks)\n├── ACI (The Teacher - Compiles context)\n└── Refinery (The Miller - Grinds code into atoms)\n```",
