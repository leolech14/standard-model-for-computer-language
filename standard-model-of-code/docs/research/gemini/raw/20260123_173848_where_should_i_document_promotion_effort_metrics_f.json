    "content": "Based on the provided codebase context and conventions, the best location for documenting PROMOTION EFFORT METRICS for the task refinery system is **(C) .agent/registry/METRICS.md**.\n\nHere's why:\n\n*   **.agent/registry/METRICS.md:** The `analysis_sets.yaml` file defines an analysis set called `agent_intelligence` that includes `.agent/intelligence/metrics/*.yaml`.  While the user query specifies `METRICS.md` (a markdown file), the general pattern is storing metrics as YAML files. Therefore it is better to save the metrics as a `.agent/registry/METRICS.yaml` file.\n\n*   **(A) .agent/docs/:** This location could be used for conceptual documents related to the agent or the kernel, but not for tracking specific performance metrics.\n\n*   **(B) context-management/docs/workflows/:** This directory would be more suited for defining the workflow itself, rather than its performance metrics.\n\n*   **(D) context-management/docs/operations/:** This directory appears to be used for operational manuals and deployment strategies, not for tracking specific metrics of subsystems.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate location to store promotion effort metrics is in `.agent/registry/METRICS.yaml`. Since the example prompt specifies to save into `.agent/registry/METRICS.md`, if the file will be edited automatically by the agent, then the format of the file should be `.yaml`. If the file is designed for humans to read (not edited automatically by the agent), then store in markdown (`.md`).\n",
