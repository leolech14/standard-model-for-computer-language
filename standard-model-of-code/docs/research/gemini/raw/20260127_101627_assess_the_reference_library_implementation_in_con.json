    "content": "Okay, I will conduct a thorough assessment of the reference library implementation as it exists in the `context-management/docs/theory/references/` directory. I will focus on validating file presence, processing script completeness, `pe` script integration, potential bugs, and the sensibility of the metadata schema. I will use information from the provided file context to inform the analysis. I will be critical and look for discrepancies between the documentation and the actual implementation. I will provide a JSON output that summarizes findings.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"assessment_results\": {\n    \"meta\": {\n      \"assessed_at\": \"2024-02-29T10:00:00Z\",\n      \"assessor\": \"Expert Software Engineer\"\n    },\n    \"file_presence\": {\n      \"status\": \"Needs Verification\",\n      \"details\": \"The existence of the files claimed to be present needs to be verified by checking against the actual filesystem.
