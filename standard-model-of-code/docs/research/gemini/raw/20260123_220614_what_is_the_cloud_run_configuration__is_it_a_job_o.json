    "content": "Based on the provided codebase context, the Cloud Run configuration is for a **Job**, not a Service.\n\nHere's the relevant information and known constraints:\n\n*   **`HOLOGRAPHIC_DEPLOYMENT_MANUAL.md`**: This document describes the deployment procedure for the Holographic-Socratic Layer.\n*   **Architecture:** States the system runs as a \"Google Cloud Run Job (Batch processing), not a service.\"\n*   **One-Click Deployment**: Details the `cloud-run-deploy.sh` script, confirming Cloud Run Job deployment.\n*   **The Triggers:** Describes using Cloud Scheduler to trigger the Cloud Run Job every 6 hours, clearly establishing it as a scheduled batch process.\n*   **Known Constraints**:\n    *   The system needs a dedicated Service Account (`socratic-trigger-sa`) with the `roles/run.invoker` role for Cloud Scheduler to trigger the Job.\n    *   Image building and job definition updates are handled by `./cloud-run-deploy.sh`, but the script might have sticky `apt-key` GPG issues, which the updated `Dockerfile` is supposed to fix.\n    *   `PERMISSION_DENIED` errors on Cloud Build might occur, requiring granting the Cloud Build Service Account (`[PROJECT_NUMBER]@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com`) the `roles/run.admin` and `roles/iam.serviceAccountUser` roles.\n    *   The \"Quartet Watchdog\" schedule runs every 6 hours which may be a constraint on the frequency of updates.\n\nTherefore, based on the documentation, the system uses a Cloud Run Job triggered by Cloud Scheduler.  There are configuration constraints related to service accounts and potential GPG key issues during image builds.\n",
