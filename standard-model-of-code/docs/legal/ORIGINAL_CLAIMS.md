## Foundational Claims

### CLAIM-001: Meta-Axiom
**"Tudo é uma analogia para tudo" / "Everything is an analogy to everything"**
- Philosophical foundation enabling cross-domain structural mapping
- Origin: Leonardo Lech, ~2021
- First documented application to code: December 2025

### CLAIM-002: Physics-Code Isomorphism
- Hypothesis that software structure follows discoverable laws analogous to physics
- Not metaphor - structural isomorphism
- Enables unified theory where none existed for 60 years

### CLAIM-003: Deterministic Intelligence Discovery
- Discovery date: December 23, 2025
- Finding: 100% classification coverage WITHOUT AI/ML
- Evidence: 91 repositories, 270,000+ nodes, 0 unknowns
- Key insight: Information is encoded in topology, frameworks, and genealogy

## Classification System Claims

### CLAIM-004: Atom Taxonomy (94 atoms)
- Tiered classification: T0 (core), T1 (stdlib), T2 (ecosystem)
- Naming convention: PHASE.TYPE.MODIFIER (e.g., LOG.FNC.M)
- Complete coverage of syntactic structures across languages

### CLAIM-005: Role Taxonomy (33 roles)
- Architectural verb taxonomy
- Categories: Query, Command, Factory, Storage, Orchestration, Validation, Transform, Event, Utility, Internal
- Mapping from structural atoms to functional roles

### CLAIM-006: RPBL Character Space
- 4-dimensional signature: Responsibility, Purity, Boundary, Lifecycle
- 9^4 = 6,561 possible states
- Bounded semantic space (< 50M total states)

### CLAIM-007: 8 Orthogonal Dimensions
- WHAT, LAYER, ROLE, BOUNDARY, STATE, EFFECT, LIFECYCLE, TRUST
- Statistically independent (proven)
- Complete coverage of code classification needs

---

## Purpose Theory Claims

### CLAIM-008: Purpose Field Hierarchy
- Four emergence levels: π₁ (atomic) → π₂ (composite) → π₃ (layer) → π₄ (codebase)
- Equation: π₁(node) = role(node)
- Emergence at every level transition (not just aggregation)

### CLAIM-009: Purpose Intelligence (Q-metrics)
- Five intrinsic metrics: Q_alignment, Q_coherence, Q_density, Q_completeness, Q_simplicity
- Holon Quality Formula: Q(H) = w_parts × Avg(Q_children) + w_intrinsic × I(H)
- Codebase Intelligence Score derivation

### CLAIM-010: Situation Formula
- Situation = Role × Layer × Lifecycle × RPBL × Domain
- Explains how 33 finite roles create infinite software variety
- Context-aware classification

## Health Model Claims

### CLAIM-011: Dual-Lens Architecture
- Geometry lens: Topology + Terrain (Elevation)
- Semantics lens: Purpose + Constraints
- Two output channels: Continuous scores (0-10) + Discrete alerts (pathogens)

### CLAIM-012: Health Formula
- H(G) = 10 × (w_T×T + w_E×E + w_G×Gd + w_A×A)
- Components: Topology, Elevation, Gradient, Alignment
- Weighted combination with empirically-tuned coefficients

### CLAIM-013: Landscape Metaphor Implementation
- Elevation function: f(cyclomatic_complexity, fan_out, LOC, maintainability_index)
- Gradient risk classification: STEEP_UPHILL, UPHILL, DOWNHILL, STEEP_DOWNHILL
- Peaks (complexity hotspots) and Valleys (simple utilities)

### CLAIM-014: Betti Numbers → Code Health Mapping
- b₀ (connected components) → fragmentation measure
- b₁ (cycles) → circular dependency measure
- Health signals: ACYCLIC, CYCLIC, HIGHLY_CYCLIC, FRAGMENTED, FRAGMENTED_CYCLIC

## Pathogen System Claims

### CLAIM-015: Seven-Category Pathogen Taxonomy
1. CONTAMINATION (pollution, binary, secrets)
2. DUPLICATION (code clones, redundancy)
3. CONFLICT (contradictions, violations)
4. MISALIGNMENT (declared vs observed behavior)
5. GAPS (missing coverage, orphans)
6. LEGACY_SPRAWL (dead code, obsolete patterns)
7. FLUFF (over-engineering, unnecessary complexity)

### CLAIM-016: Pathogen Override Rule
- Critical pathogens override all scores to grade F
- Prevents "good metrics hiding fatal flaws"

### CLAIM-017: Two-Tier Truth Model
- Axioms: Hard physics (binary pass/fail, non-negotiable)
- Q-metrics: Soft thermodynamics (continuous 0-1, contextual)
- Different treatment in scoring and reporting

### CLAIM-018: Q_purity Decomposition
- Q_effect_fidelity (declared effect matches observed)
- Q_boundary_integrity (boundary classification honored)
- Q_layer_integrity (layer constraints respected)

- Solves false-positive orphan problem

### CLAIM-021: Disconnection Taxonomy
- 7-type classification replacing generic "orphan" label
- reachability_source: unreachable, entry_point, test_entry, framework_managed, cross_language, dynamic_target, external_boundary
- Confidence scoring for each classification
