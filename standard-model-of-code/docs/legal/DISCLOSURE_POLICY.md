# Disclosure Policy - Standard Model of Code

> **Purpose:** Define what can be shared publicly vs. under NDA vs. kept secret.

## Disclosure Tiers

### TIER 1: PUBLIC (Blog, Talks, Open Source)

**Theory (high-level):**
- The existence of a unified code theory
- Three planes concept (Physical, Virtual, Semantic)
- 16-level scale concept (without full details)
- The physics-code analogy (general)
- "100% coverage without AI" claim (without methodology)

**Categories (not internals):**
- That we have atoms, roles, dimensions (not full lists)
- That we have a health model (not the formula)
- That we have pathogen detection (not the rules)

**Demos:**
- Sanitized visualizations
- Aggregate statistics
- Non-sensitive example outputs

**Philosophy:**
- "Tudo é uma analogia para tudo"
- The deterministic pivot story
- Perplexity refutation argument

---

### TIER 2: NDA / PAYING CUSTOMERS

**Full taxonomies:**
- Complete 94-atom list with definitions
- Complete 33-role list with detection criteria
- 8 dimensions with full specifications
- RPBL character space details

**Formulas (structure, not weights):**
- Health formula: H = T + E + Gd + A
- Q-metrics definitions
- Purpose field equations

**Architecture:**
- 28-stage pipeline structure
- Codome boundary types
- Disconnection taxonomy

**Comparative analysis:**
- How we differ from SonarQube, etc.
- Benchmark methodology (not results)

---

### TIER 3: TRADE SECRET (Internal Only)

**Weights and thresholds:**
- Exact coefficients in health formula
- Detection thresholds for atoms/roles
- Confidence calibration values
- False-positive suppression rules

**Training data:**
- The 91 repositories used for validation
- Benchmark datasets
- Ground truth labels

**Detection rules:**
- Pattern matching specifics for atoms
- Heuristics for role inference
- Pathogen detection algorithms

**Competitive intelligence:**
- Detailed comparison results
- Performance benchmarks
- Customer-specific insights

## Decision Matrix

| Want to share... | Check | Decision |
|------------------|-------|----------|
| High-level concept | Is it in TIER 1? | Share freely |
| Taxonomy details | Is it in TIER 2? | Require NDA |
| Weights/thresholds | Is it in TIER 3? | Never share |
| New discovery | Does it strengthen our moat? | Evaluate carefully |
| Customer data | Ever? | NEVER |

## Pre-Publication Checklist

Before ANY public disclosure:

1. [ ] Does it reveal TIER 3 content? → STOP
2. [ ] Does it reveal TIER 2 content? → Require NDA
3. [ ] Could a competitor replicate our core value from this? → STOP
4. [ ] Is it timestamped in our provenance trail? → If not, timestamp first
5. [ ] Does it conflict with potential patent filing? → Consult counsel

## Specific Guidance

### Blog Posts / Articles
- OK: Philosophy, high-level architecture, the "why"
- NOT OK: Full formulas, detection rules, weights

### Conference Talks
- OK: Vision, demo with sanitized data, results (aggregate)
- NOT OK: "How to build this yourself" level detail

### Academic Papers
- CAUTION: Papers require significant disclosure
- Strategy: Publish on non-core aspects OR after patent filing

### Open Source
- OK: Graph extraction, basic visualization, file parsing
- NOT OK: Atom detection, role inference, health scoring

### Sales / Marketing
- OK: Capabilities, results, comparisons (qualitative)
- NOT OK: Technical implementation details

## Exception Process

To disclose TIER 2 or TIER 3 content:

1. Written request to IP owner (Leonardo Lech)
2. Business justification
3. Risk assessment
4. Mitigation plan (NDA, limited scope, etc.)
5. Approval in writing

---

## Incident Response

If accidental disclosure occurs:

1. Document what was disclosed, when, to whom
2. Assess damage (can competitor use this?)
3. Notify IP owner immediately
4. Consider: Can we still file patents? (grace period in US)
5. Update disclosure policy if needed
